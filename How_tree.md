Week 6: How to be a tree
========================

This week’s class is incredibly important – understanding how plants
actually grow (and no, it’s not like what you see in the movies!).

We are going to start by learning about the main cell types in plant
leaves, cells and roots (including their structure and function). Next,
you will cut a cross section of a primary stem, identify the different
types of cells and tissues, and draw a diagram of what you see. Finally,
you will learn how secondary thickening works in dicotyledons.

The practical skills you should aim to perfect in this lab are:

1.  recognition of the major cell types in plant stems

2.  section cutting by hand with a razor blade, staining and mounting
    sections

3.  using a compound microscope and drawing what you see

***FEEDBACK***: **You will likely be assessed on biological drawing from
microscope sections in the practical exam. Hand in your drawing of the
*Juncus* cladode and we will provide feedback.** <span

Plant Cells
-----------

![](./myMediaFolder/media/image1.png)Various different types of cells
are found in the mature plant body. Each performs a specific function.
You will be looking at a range of different plant tissues and you will
be expected to be able to identify the major cell types. The notes given
below should help to clarify the important features of each type.

### Parenchyma 

The term parenchyma is used for tissues composed of *living* cells
generally having *thin wholly primary walls* and a *polyhedral shape* [A
wall is said to be wholly primary if the thickening of the wall is
completed before the cell has reached its full size, any thickening laid
down after the cell has reached its full size is said to be secondary.]

Parenchyma is the main representative of the ground tissue system: this
forms a continuous tissue in all major plant organs, e.g., cortex of
roots, pith and cortex of stems, ground tissue of petioles and mesophyll
of leaves. In herbaceous plants 80% of the plant body is composed of
parenchyma. Parenchyma cells also occur as components of complex tissue
systems (such as xylem and phloem) either scattered singly or
aggregated. A number of types of parenchyma can be recognised including:

> ![](./myMediaFolder/media/image2.png) **chlorenchyma**: parenchyma
> containing chloroplasts, most often found in leaves and the outsides
> of stems.
>
> ![](./myMediaFolder/media/image3.jpeg)
>
> **Storage parenchyma **
>
> Contains stored food reserves, most commonly starch grains but other
> reserves also occur such as sucrose, inulin etc.; may be found
> throughout the plant or concentrated in special storage organs such as
> tubers, rhizomes, storage roots etc. (e.g. amylophasts in potatoes);

### ![](./myMediaFolder/media/image4.jpeg) Collenchyma

Collenchyma is a living tissue composed of more or less elongated cells
with thick, non-lignified primary walls. The wall material is deposited
unevenly and is particularly thick at cell corners. The cell walls are
made of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin [not lignin] and normally
stain a very bright pink with toluidine blue.

It is the main supporting tissue in the leaves and stems of many
dicotyledons, for example in the midrib and petiole of leaves and in
strands in the outer cortex of stems (often forming ridges). Collenchyma
is well adapted to function as support tissue in growing organs, as it
combines high tensile strength with considerable plasticity. Unlike
sclerenchyma it is extensible.

### ![](./myMediaFolder/media/image5.png)Sclerenchyma 

Sclerenchyma refers to a tissue composed of cells with thick, rigid,
secondary walls (usually but not always lignified) whose function is
support and/or protection; frequently the cells lack protoplasts at
maturity. Many different cell types are involved but two major groups
are recognized: fibres and sclereids.

-   <span id="fibres-1" class="anchor"></span>**Fibres** are long
    tapered interlocking cells, normally unbranched. Typically without
    protoplasts at maturity and with obscure simple pitting; frequently,
    but not always, lignified (unlignified fibres are most often
    associated with phloem). Fibres may occur singly or in groups and
    are often associated with vascular tissue.

Fibres produced by plants have been used commercially for centuries. At
present, plants from 44 different families are used as sources of fibre.
Common commercial fibres may be divided into textile fibres including
flax (*Linum usitatissimum*) jute (*Corchorus* spp.) and hemp (*Cannabis
sativa* - yes it does have a legitimate use!). Extraction of most fibres
is by a process called "retting". This decomposes the middle lamellae
between cells so that they separate. The plant material is left in water
while decomposition occurs, then dried and passed between rollers which
separates the fibres from the outer tissue.

-   <span id="sclereids-1" class="anchor"></span>**Sclereids:** These
    vary greatly in shape. They differ from fibres in that they do not
    have a very elongated simple shape. Usually they have very thick
    secondary walls with obvious pits and are strongly lignified. Often
    classified on the basis of shape, but according to Esau (1977), this
    is of limited use because the various forms intergrade. These cells,
    individually or in groups are widely distributed in the plant body,
    but are particularly common in leaves, fruits and seeds.

### Xylem vessels and tracheids

Xylem is a complex tissue, composed of conducting (or tracheary)
elements, fibres and parenchyma. Conducting elements are of two kinds,
**tracheids** and **vessel members**. Both are elongated cells, thick
walled and without living contents at maturity. The secondary wall is
laid down in various patterns and usually becomes lignified.

-   **Tracheids** are normally elongated and pointed at both ends.
    Tracheids are present in all divisions of vascular plants, and are
    the only tracheary elements in pteridophytes and gymnosperms.

-   **Vessels** consist of chains of cells in a longitudinal file. They
    are present in the wood of nearly all angiosperms. In each file of
    cells the transverse end walls are perforated so that the lumens of
    adjacent cells are in continuity. Each 'cell' is known as a **vessel
    member**. Although vessel members are very short, vessels may be
    several centimetres long in some species. Xylem elements which
    differentiate during early phases of growth, usually have a thin
    primary wall with rings or helices of secondary wall thickening
    deposited on it. These 'annular' or 'helical' xylem elements (see
    figures) are extensible and often become very much stretched during
    the elongation of the organ in which they occur so that the
    thickenings become more widely spaced. Later formed elements have
    more extensive regions of secondary wall thickening and are not
    extensible.

### Phloem

Phloem is a complex tissue comprising sieve tubes, companion cells,
parenchyma, fibres and sclereids. The transporting elements are called
the sieve elements. These are of two kinds, **sieve cells** (which occur
in pteridophytes and gymnosperms) and **sieve tubes** which occur in
angiosperms.

-   ![](./myMediaFolder/media/image8.jpeg)**Sieve cells** are elongated
    cells with special sieve areas in lateral and occasionally terminal
    walls.

-   **Sieve tubes** are longitudinal files of cells, each of which is
    called a **sieve tube member**. In these cells the sieve areas in
    the transverse walls are specialized and form a **sieve plate** (see
    Figure). This is a porous region of the wall through which the
    protoplasts of adjacent sieve tube members interconnect. Mature
    sieve elements have living contents (protoplasts) although they
    usually lack normal nucleus. They are usually closely associated
    with **companion cells** (see Figure). (These both originate by
    division of the same cell.) Companion cells are elongated cells with
    living contents including large nuclei and dense cytoplasm. From one
    to several companion cells are associated with each sieve element
    and it is thought that there is a close functional relationship
    between them, but the precise function of companion cells is
    controversial.

### Practical exercise 1: Petiole of *Apium graveolens* (celery)

Cut a transverse section (T.S.) of a celery petiole, stain with
toluidine blue and mount in 50% glycerol. Make sure the sections pass
through vascular bundles.

Draw two labelled diagrams that show:

1)  Parenchyma and collenchyma

2)  A vascular bundle

Pull a “string” from the outside of the celery stalk. Is it stretchy?
Why? What type of cell is this?

### Practical exercise 2: THE PRIMARY STEM: *Cucurbita* sp.

Examine xylem tissue in prepared slides of transverse (G11/1) sections
of *Cucurbita* (cucumber) stem. Draw pictures showing the major
structures and cell types. Make sure you find the phloem, the xylem,
fibres, parenchyma, vascular bundles and the epidermis.

Practical exercise 3: Secondary Thickening
------------------------------------------

<span id="secondary-growth-in-herbaceous-plants" class="anchor"><span
id="activity-of-the-vascular-cambium"
class="anchor"></span></span>Examine a prepared slide of a transverse
section of a first year stem of *Cinnamomum camphora*.

There is already an active vascular cambium that has laid down a small
amount of secondary xylem (although no secondary phloem is yet
apparent). The cambium is thin-walled and tends to have been crushed
during sectioning. Note the areas of more irregular primary xylem
surrounding the pith.

Draw and label a low power diagram to indicate the distribution of
tissues in the stem.

Note particularly the following primary tissues or regions:

-   pith - what types of cells are present?

-   pericyclic fibres - groups of thick-walled fibres outside the
    phloem - about how many cells separate adjacent fibre bundles?

-   cortex - what type(s) of cells are present

-   epidermis - closely fitting epidermal cells with domeshaped outer
    walls, carrying a well developed cuticle.

PRACTICAL ADVICE ON SECTIONING AND STAINING, USING A MICROSCOPE, AND BOTANICAL DRAWING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sectioning and Staining
-----------------------

Sectioning can be done by hand with a razor blade, or by using a
mechanical cutting device (a microtome) that holds the material and
advances it a section-thick distance after each slice of the knife.

### Sectioning By Hand

You will require:

1.  a Petri dish or watch glass with a 0.5 cm depth of water;

2.  a small paint-brush;

3.  a *new* razor-blade (carefully protect its cutting edge all the
    time).

Hold the material with your left (or non-dextrous) hand so that the
plane of cutting will be horizontal. The aim is to cut smoothly and
fairly quickly producing dozens of sections from which a few are chosen:
it is worth noting that it is often the incomplete sections with thin
'running-out' edges that provide the best study. The razor blade surface
should be wet with one or two drops of water to prevent the newly-cut
sections from drying out. When several sections mount up on the blade
they are swept carefully off with the wet paint-brush into the water in
the Petri dish.

**Do not let the material dry out at any stage.**

### <span id="staining-schedules" class="anchor"><span id="mounting-sections" class="anchor"><span id="staining-schedules-1" class="anchor"></span></span></span>Staining with Toluidine blue

**All stains should be treated as potential carcinogens and you should
take care not to stain yourself. To protect skin and clothes from
accidental staining please wipe up any spills immediately.**

Toluidine Blue is a very important dye that distinguishes lignified from
unlignified walls. It is a positively charged dye which stains negative
groups. Lignified walls stain blue and unlignified walls stain pink or
purple. The pectin and hemicellulose fractions of the wall stain pink.
Cellulose does not stain.

### Cell Chemical Group That Staining Structure Reacts With Colour

1.  cytoplasm (phosphate groups in nucleic acids) purple

2.  nucleus (phosphate groups in DNA) blue

3.  cell walls (COOH groups in some unlignified carbohydrates e.g.
    pectin) pink

4.  lignified walls (phenols) green to blue (turquoise blue)

5.  some vacuoles (phenols) deep dark blue

### Staining and mounting specimens

1.  Place the staining solution in a watch glass. Prepare a second watch
    glass about 2/3 full of distilled water ready for rinsing.

2.  Transfer section from water to a drop of toluidine blue in a watch
    glass.

3.  Leave until you can see differentiation of pink and blue tissue
    (seconds to minutes).

4.  Transfer to distilled water in a second watch glass for a few
    seconds to wash out excess stain.

5.  Transfer to a clean dry slide Sections can be mounted either in
    water or a drop of 50% glycerol. Cover with a clean cover-slip,
    lowered gently from one side to exclude air bubbles.

<span id="safranin-and-fast-green" class="anchor"><span id="light-microscopy" class="anchor"></span></span>Light Microscopy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="olympus-microscope" class="anchor"></span>**Operating
procedure**

1.  Place the microscope in a comfortable position on the bench.

2.  Check that on/off switch (right hand side of base) is in the off
    position and the brightness control is at zero.

3.  Plug in and switch on at the centre of the bench.

4.  Turn on microscope lamp and increase brightness control until you
    can see some light coming through the condenser.

5.  Make sure the 4x objective is in position.

6.  Place specimen slide on stage and hold in position with stage clip.
    THE SPECIMEN SHOULD NEVER BE VIEWED WITHOUT A COVERSLIP.

7.  Position specimen under 4x objective using mechanical stage
    controls.

8.  Focus. Adjust brightness control if necessary.

9.  Make interpupillary and diopter adjustments (see below).

10. Swing in desired objective. Re-focus.

11. Check that condenser height is optimum (should be raised above image
    of ground glass screen).

12. Close iris diaphragm to 2/3 (70%) of the exit pupil of objective
    (see below).

13. Fine focus and observe.

*How to correct interpupillary distance and diopter settings*

1.  Hold the knurled dovetail slides of the right and left eyepiece
    tubes with both hands and put the tubes together, or pull them apart
    laterally, whichever is required, while looking through the
    eyepieces with both eyes, until perfect binocular vision is
    obtained.

2.  Rotate the tube length adjustment ring on the right eyepiece tube to
    match your interpupillary distance setting, which is given on the
    scale above and left of the right hand eyepiece.

3.  Look at the image through the right hand eyepiece with your right
    eye and focus on the specimen with the coarse and fine adjustment
    knobs.

4.  Next, looking at the image through the left eyepiece with your left
    eye rotate the tube length of this eyepiece to focus on the specimen
    without altering the coarse and fine adjustment knobs.

### Automatic pre-focussing

This lever (inside ring of left hand focusing knob) locks the microscope
at a particular coarse focus position to prevent further upward travel
of the stage by means of the coarse adjustment knob. It prevents damage
to objectives as a result of focusing the specimen slide up through the
objective lens. It does not restrict fine focusing.

### Aperture iris diaphragm

The lever on the condenser controls the aperture iris diaphragm
adjustment. The iris diaphragm should be adjusted to match the numerical
aperture of the objective in use in order to get the best result.
However, since the image usually lacks contrast a compromise is made and
the diaphragm is stopped down to about 70% of the objective numerical
aperture.

Remove the eyepieces: the circle of light represents the exit pupil of
the objective. Adjust the diaphragm using the condenser lever until the
iris impinges on the exit pupil by about 1/3. This should always be done
when objectives are changed.

### Dos and don'ts

1.  If lenses are dirty you may clean them, but only with either a
    blower brush or a fresh piece of lens tissue - NOT KLEENEX. (Xylene,
    alcohol or ether may be used in small amounts as a cleaning fluid.)

2.  When carrying the microscope, keep it upright so that the eyepieces
    do not fall out. USE BOTH HANDS.

3.  The tension on the coarse focus can be altered by rotating the
    innermost ring on the right-hand focus adjustment knob.

4.  DO NOT TWIST THE TWO COARSE ADJUSTMENT KNOBS IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
    SIMULTANEOUSLY AS THIS WILL CAUSE DAMAGE.

5.  Do not spill water, oil or acid on the mechanical stage or any other
    part of the microscope. Oil or water between the slide and stage
    causes friction so that the slide will not move easily.

Diagram of a light microscope

<span id="botanical-drawing" class="anchor"></span>

Botanical drawing {#botanical-drawing-1}
-----------------

In this course we are not asking you to produce works of art (or
imagination), but accurate representations of what you can see down the
microscope. You are all capable of this - the principal requirements are
practice and a sharp pencil (preferably HB).

There are two types of drawing, and \*each should be accompanied by a
scale:

![](./myMediaFolder/media/image10.png)

In a low power plan individual cells should not appear. The aim is to
indicate boundaries between different tissues. Clearly you will need to
introduce some simplification into such a diagram. For example,
boundaries with many small scale convolutions may be portrayed as a
straight line and diffuse boundaries by dotted lines.

### High Power Drawing

This should be an accurate drawing of a small number of cells. It should
show details of cell outline and as much internal structure as is
discernable. For example, if you are drawing a cell with chloroplasts,
you should draw them in the correct position to the correct size, shape
and number: they should not be drawn as a vague collection of squiggles
around the edge of the cell. Cell walls, if accurately represented, will
rarely have breaks in them.

Thick cell walls should be represented by a double line, and thin cell
walls by a single line. You can use the distance between the two
"double" lines to indicate wall thickness. Each cell should be enclosed
by a completed line. See these points in the example below. Note how the
thick walls of the epidermis, collenchyma and fibres are separated from
intercellular space.

![](./myMediaFolder/media/image11.png)

An example of a good high power drawing

### <span id="constructing-a-scale" class="anchor"><span id="general-points" class="anchor"></span></span>General points

1.  Make drawings large.

2.  All drawings should have a heading stating organ, species and plane
    of section.

3.  All drawings should be in pencil. It is also highly desirable that
    labels should be in pencil so that corrections can be made easily
    and neatly.

4.  Labels should appear to the side of a drawing and not be written
    across it. A *straight* line, and not an arrow, should connect the
    label to the area it refers to - the labels should be arranged in
    such a way that the lines do not cross. Labels should give detailed
    information about composition of structures where possible, based on
    staining reactions, eg. lignified wall.

5.  It is usually not necessary to use cross-hatching or stippling to
    indicate particular tissue types in low power diagrams. If you must
    clarify your drawings by cross-hatching, make sure it is neat and
    does not cross the boundary line of the tissue. An example of the
    use of shading is given on page 12.

6.  While drawing you should be constantly altering the plane of focus
    of the microscope in order to clarify details. You should also be
    prepared to change the objective: to a higher power to help the
    interpretation of fine detail; to a lower power to appreciate the
    relationship of what you are drawing to the structure of the whole
    organ.
