PRACTICAL 1 (WEEK 2): VEGETATIVE MORPHOLOGY & INTRODUCTION TO
IDENTIFICATION KEYS.

**1. THE NATURE OF LEAVES**

The flowering plants are the culmination of just one evolutionary
pathway in vascular plants. This laboratory aims to place them in the
context of the diverse array of vascular plants and trace the evolution
of some basic aspects of their morphology. The first section of this
laboratory aims to illustrate the less specialised organisation of the
plant body found in the non-flowering plants and from which angiosperm
morphology has been derived, while the latter part of the lab introduces
the use of identification keys. The rest of the course concentrates on
the flowering plants, and will consider form and function of the various
organs of this group in more detail.

The purpose of many of the questions in this lab is to encourage you to
look carefully at your material to see what is really there.

Note the increasing specialisation of organs carrying out
photosynthesis. In the earliest plants ordinary cylindrical stems were
the organs of photosynthesis. In later groups some of the features of
stems are still discernible in the leaves: eg. highly divided and
branching in 3 dimensions; indeterminate growth.

The developments of new organs such as axillary buds, and the
specialisation of organs to serve new functions such as aids to
climbing, are also illustrated.

Division PSILOPHYTA: A single living order, Psilotales.

The earliest known vascular plants consisted of a system of cylindrical
axes. The cortical tissues of the above ground parts had stomata and a
cuticle and were photosynthetic, while the epidermis of the underground
parts had no cuticle but produced hair-like outgrowths to aid absorption
of water and minerals. Such plants are only known from the fossil
record, but there are two living genera that approach this simple level
of organisation. These are *Psilotum* and *Tmesipteris*, both native to
Australia.

1\. Examine the plant of *Psilotum nudum*. It consists of a stem system
bearing small *microphylls*. The stem grows by a single apical initial
rather than a meristem (a group of initials).

> a\) Examine the branching of the stem. Can you distinguish a main axis
> bearing lateral branches, or are all branches of equal size and growth?
> This type of branching, where there is no main axis bearing laterals, is
> termed *dichotomous*. It is the oldest (most primitive) form of
> branching in plants, being common in the algae.
>
> b\) Determine what, if any, relationship exists between microphyll and
> branch
>
> position. Does this plant have axillary buds? If there are no actual
> buds, from which point and in what manner do branches form?

c.  Are apical buds present? Check the definition of bud in the
    glossary.

<!-- -->

d.  How do you think new aerial stems are produced from below ground?

> e\) What would be the effect of browsing or pruning the tips of the
> aerial parts of the plant?

Division PTEROPHYTA - The Ferns: Order Filicales.

Members of this order have roots, stems and leaves, but the latter are
*megaphylls*, and are not homologous with the microphylls of the
previous group. In the Filicales there is no main root system, the roots
being lateral organs borne on the stems (*adventitious* roots).

2\. Examine the specimen of *Lygodium scandens*. The stem grows
horizontally below the surface of the ground (it is a *rhizome*); only
the leaves are visible. Each leaf grows for one year, climbing on other
plants towards the light, but eventually dies back to be replaced by a
new one the next year.

a.  Do the leaves show determinate or indeterminate growth?

<!-- -->

b.  Note the growing apex of a leaf is coiled up to protect the initial
    cell that is responsible for the growth. All fern leaves uncoil at
    the apex like this – why is this adaptive?

c.  Use the drawings in Figs.1.1. and 1.2 to identify the primary and
    secondary leaflets (*pinnae* and *pinnules*), and the primary and
    secondary *rachises*.

<!-- -->

b.  How would you describe the primary branching in the leaf? Is there
    any evidence of dichotomous branching in these leaves?

<!-- -->

b.  Note that the veins in the leaflets (pinnules) are in the form of an
    open system where the branches end blindly rather than joining to
    form a net.

<!-- -->

d.  What, if any, part of *Psilotum nudum* would be homologous with the
    leaf of *Lygodium scandens*? Is any organ of the latter homologous
    with the microphylls of the former?

![](media/image1.jpeg)

3\. Examine the specimen of *Gleichenia* sp. Note the small fibrous
adventitious roots that arise at any point along the stem, and the large
divided (compound) megaphylls. Again these leaves uncoil during growth.

a.  Determine the relationship (if any) between leaf positions and
    branching of the stem. Does this species have axillary buds? How are
    branches initiated in the stem system?

> b\) Use the diagrams in Fig. 1.1 to determine what type of branching is
> present in the leaf.
>
> How many orders of branching are there in a leaf? Identify the
> primary, secondary and tertiary rachises.

c.  Compare a one-year-old leaf with a two-year-old leaf. Is there any
    evidence of indeterminate growth in these leaves?

d.  Examine the apex of the rhizome (underground stem). Does this plant
    have an apical bud? Is there any protection of the growing apex?

Division CONIFEROPHYTA - The Conifers: a single order, Coniferales.

These are seed plants without fruit or flowers. They are thought to have
evolved separately from the flowering plants, and dominated the world's
vegetation during the cooler and drier period that followed the
Carboniferous.

4\. Examine the specimen of *Podocarpus elatus* (Plum Pine), a conifer
native to the closed forests of eastern Australia. The leaves of
conifers are also interpreted as megaphylls, ie. as having evolved from
a lateral branch that has become determinate in growth and flattened to
enhance interception of light.

> a\) Note the simple leaves that characterise the order. Are the leaves
> strictly determinate in growth? How are they arranged? What term(s) best
> describe the **phyllotaxis** (leaf arrangement)?
>
> b\) Hold a leaf up against the light and examine the pattern of the veins
> with a hand lens. Can you detect any lateral veins branching from the
> midrib? These leaves have a continuous sheet of tracheid-like cells
> between the adaxial and abaxial mesophyll tissue that distributes water
> laterally through the lamina from the single midvein.
>
> c\) Examine the pattern of branching of the stem. Look for axillary buds
> in leaf axils.
>
> Does this plant have axillary branching as in angiosperms or apical
> branching as in ferns?
>
> d\) Examine the growing apex closely. Rather than a naked apical
> meristem, this
>
> order has the meristem protected within a bud. Note that the bud
> consists of a meristem enclosed with embryonic leaves, but that these
> are themselves enclosed within a group of **bud scales**, ie., reduced
> and hardened leaves that protect the bud. When the apex starts growing
> next spring, the bud scales fall off (leaving scars where they were
> attached) and the new vegetative leaves expand as the stem grows out
> of the bud. The positions of previous **winter buds** can be seen at
> intervals down the stem. They appear as rings of scars where the bud
> scales were attached.
>
> Given that each winter bud marks the end of a year's growth, how old
> is the basal internode of the specimen you are examining?

Division ANTHOPHYTA (Angiosperms).

There are many orders of flowering plants. All are characterised by the
possession of a carpel, pollination at a distance from the micropyle of
the ovule, and double fertilisation via a pollen tube. Like the previous
two divisions their leaves are megaphylls, although there is some
evidence that the megaphyll evolved separately in each group. Unlike
conifers, the leaves of angiosperms may be simple or compound.

5.  Examine the specimen of *Abelia triflora* (Abelia). Note that it has
    simple leaves with a short petiole, and that the laminas of these
    are mostly arranged in the one plane, spreading out either side of
    the stem. Note carefully how leaves are attached at successive
    nodes.

<!-- -->

a.  Which term(s) (see Fig. 1.2) best describes the phyllotaxis (leaf
    arrangement) of Abelia?

> b\) Using a hand lens and holding the leaf against the light, examine the
> venation pattern in the leaf lamina.
>
> Are there any free vein endings in the leaf? Which term best describes
> this pattern? How does this pattern differ from that in the leaflet of
> a fern? Which pattern do you consider to be the more specialised,
> given that both leaves evolved from a set of branches? Give your
> reasons.

c.  Examine the relationship between stems, leaves and branches. How do
    branches arise on the stem? Does this plant have axillary branching?
    Does each leaf axil contain a bud? How can you distinguish a branch
    of Abelia bearing two rows of simple leaves from a single pinnate
    leaf?

> Fill in your answers to the above in Table 1.1.

6.  Examine the leaves on the pea seedlings (*Pisum sativum*) on your
    bench. Each leaf is compound, consisting of a petiole terminating in
    a rachis bearing several pairs of rounded leaflets.

<!-- -->

a.  Which term(s) best describes the form of these leaves (see Fig.
    1.2).

<!-- -->

b.  Identify the pair of large rounded stipules associated with each
    node, and resembling a basal pair of leaflets that are attached
    directly to the stem. Note how they enclose the apical bud of the
    main axis. What possible adaptive value could these stipules have?

<!-- -->

c.  Which term(s) best describe the phyllotaxis (leaf arrangement - see
    Fig. 1.2).

<!-- -->

d.  Does this plant have axillary buds?

> Fill in the appropriate information in Table 1.1.

7.  Examine the specimen of *Acacia elata* (Cedar Wattle).

> a\) How much constitutes a leaf? Look for axillary buds that may arise in
> the axils of
>
> leaves, but never in the axils of leaflets. Also look for the largest
> repeated unit of organisation. The leaf is the largest determinate
> unit of organisation, as distinct from the indeterminate stem system.

b.  Identify the petiole, rachis, primary leaflets (pinnae) and
    secondary leaflets (pinnules). Are the primary and secondary
    leaflets strictly paired? Is there a terminal leaflet on the primary
    rachis? Is there a terminal secondary leaflet on the secondary
    rachises? Which term(s) best describe the form of these compound
    leaves? (see Fig. 1.2).

<!-- -->

c.  Are there stipules present?

<!-- -->

d.  Look for the doughnut- or volcano-shaped glands (**nectaries**) that
    are a characteristic feature of the petiole and/or the rachis of
    *Acacia* species. What could be the adaptive value of such
    nectaries?

e.  Compare the form of these leaves with those of *Gleichenia*. In
    which respects do they differ? Which of these two forms of leaf most
    closely resembles a stem system? (ie., which is the more primitive
    megaphyll?) Which features of the *Acacia* do you consider to be
    advanced, and which do you consider primitive?

<!-- -->

8.  In some angiosperms the process of adaptation has blurred the
    functional distinction between leaves and stems. Some such examples
    are considered below.

<!-- -->

a.  In each of specimens A, B and C, use your knowledge of the
    relationship between stems, leaves and axillary branches to work out
    what constitutes a leaf, and then enter in Table 1.1 the appropriate
    terminology from Fig 1.2 to describe the form and arrangement of the
    leaves.

> b\) In the following cases, some part of the plant has been modified to
> serve as an aid
>
> to climbing.

i.  Examine the **tendrils** on the young pea plants supplied. Each
    > tendril arises from near the end of a compound leaf, in the
    > position in which you find a leaflet (CHECK THIS) on a leaf that
    > has no tendril.

> Hence, we can conclude that the development has been modified so that
> the tissues that normally develop into the leaflet grow into a tendril
> instead (ie., the tendril is a modified leaflet/pinna).
>
> ii\) Now examine the tendrils on the branch of *Cissus* sp. Each arises
> on the stem
>
> opposite a leaf. This suggests that the plant originally had leaves in
> opposite pairs, and that one has been modified to form the tendril.
>
> To check this explanation, find a node at which no tendril has been
> formed.
>
> Does this node bear a pair of leaves, or a single leaf? This shows
> that our initial interpretation is wrong. The tendril cannot be a
> modified leaf.
>
> Is the tendril in the correct position to have arisen from an axillary
> bud?
>
> If it is neither a modified leaf nor a modified axillary branch, it
> must in fact be a
>
> modification of the tip of the main axis.
>
> In this species, each time a tendril is formed it uses up the apical
> meristem in the apical bud, so continued growth of the plant can only
> come from an axillary bud emerging from the axil between the last leaf
> and the tendril. As it grows, the axillary branch pushes the tendril
> to the side, and forms a continuation of the vertical axis of the
> plant. So the plant axis is formed by a new "side branch" at each node
> bearing a tendril. This pattern of growth is described as **sympodial
> growth**. Sympodial growth is also seen in some plants where the
> apical bud is used up to form a flower.
>

**2. INTRODUCTION TO THE USE OF AN IDENTIFICATION KEY**

The aims of this exercise are to learn how to use an identification key,
and also to become familiar with a range of common vegetative features
of plants. Use the preceding section and the glossary to understand all
the terms in the key.

A key is a device that progressively eliminates a series of
possibilities until the identification is completed. At each step in the
process it asks you to choose which of a pair of contrasting conditions
or characters occurs in your specimen, and then directs you to the next
appropriate choice depending on the condition chosen. It is important to
realise that you do **not** have to use all the possible alternatives
for any one specimen. The contrasting alternatives can be arranged in
either of the following ways:

> a\) In **Bracketed Keys** the contrasting alternatives are placed
> together, usually under a single
>
> number. Each alternative directs you to the numbered alternative that
> should be examined next. Hence, the first alternative under number 1
> might direct you to 2 (the second pair of contrasting conditions),
> while the second alternative under 1 may direct you to 13, omitting
> all the intervening pairs (2 to 12).
>
> b\) In **Indented Keys** the contrasting alternatives are marked with the
> same symbols (numbers or letters) and indented or inset the same
> distance from the left hand margin, but are not necessarily placed
> directly under each other; indeed, they can sometimes be on different
> pages of the book, so one has to search for the alternative. Commonly
> the first and second alternatives are distinguished as A and \*A, B
> and \*B, etc. Having decided which alternative best fits the specimen,
> proceed to the pair of alternatives that immediately *follows* the
> correct alternative (**downwards!**). Hence, if your specimen fits the
> second of two alternatives, say \*B, ignore all the choices listed below
> B and go to the first choice listed under \*B.

In **both** types, it is essential to -

> i\) always proceed downwards;
>
> ii\) **read both alternatives carefully** **before** deciding which best
> fits the specimen, and check any unfamiliar terms in the glossary.
> **Never** decide that the first alternative is correct before you read
> the second of the contrasting pair!
>
> Now turn to the key on page 110. This is a key that uses only
> vegetative characters. The advantage of such a key is that it does not
> require you to have flowers or fruit, which are only on the tree in
> certain seasons. Use this key to identify at least two of the
> specimens G to K.

**3. THE PLANT COLLECTION**

See details at the end of the lab manual for plant collection
guidelines. While the collection is not due until week 8, we suggest
that you begin work on this project as soon as possible.

**4. RESEARCH IN BOTANY**

See details at the end of the lab manual and on Moodle for the research
in botany guidelines. The final submission for research in botany is
close to the end of the session. Once again, we suggest that you begin
work on this project early.

PRAC 2 (WEEK 3): PLANT CELLS

You should refer to the notes on Light Microscopy and the use of the
Olympus CHA Microscope which you will find in the manual introduction.

Only a few types of cell are found in higher plants. These can be
recognised easily on several basic features:

-shape

-wall thickness

-wall composition

-whether empty or full of cytoplasm

-presence or absence of specific organelles such as chloroplasts.

Once you are familiar with the diagnostic features of various cell
types, you can recognise these in any unknown section and use the
information to work out complex tissue arrangements in leaves, stems or
roots.

The practical skills you should aim to perfect in this lab are:

\(a) recognition of the major cell types in supporting and ground tissue;

\(b) section cutting by hand with a razor blade;

\(c) drawing.

**Note:** see the introductory notes in the front of this manual.

This practical deals *only* with the cell types found in "ground" and
supporting tissue. Cells modified for transport are dealt with later.

**Parenchyma and Collenchyma**

Celery is a leaf petiole. Strip off one of the celery "strings" - these
are strands of collenchyma tissue. Do not confuse collenchyma with the
vascular bundles. Note how elastic the strings are.

Cut several thin transverse sections of the petiole. Stain your thinnest
sections with toluidine blue. You should stain them until the whole
section becomes a deep purple with blue areas in the vascular bundles.
The collenchyma walls now stain purple. Are these walls lignified? What
colour do lignified walls stain?

Make a high power drawing of three collenchyma cells showing the
position of wall thickenings and middle lamella. How is a plant cell
wall deposited?

Cut an L.S. and stain with toluidine blue and examine. Locate the ends
of the cells. Make a sketch to illustrate the shape in 3-D of a
collenchyma cell. How much longer are they than wide?

Compare the parenchyma cells in the ground tissue with the collenchyma
with respect to the following:

\(i) overall cell diameter

\(ii) diameter of cell lumen

\(iii) colour of wall staining with toluidine blue

\(iv) cell length

\(iv) wall thickness

\(v) appearance of intercellular space

Make a high power drawing of **3 parenchyma** cells for comparison with
the collenchyma to illustrate the differences.

**Aerenchyma and Chlorenchyma**

These are two common types of specialised parenchyma.

Cut sections of the *Juncus* cladode. Rinse for 10 minutes, then stain
with toluidine blue and examine

The pith of the cladode is filled with *aerenchyma* while the cortex is
*chlorenchyma*.

What is the characteristic of chlorenchyma?

What are the diagnostic features of aerenchyma, with respect to wall
thickness and staining, cell contents and cell shape?

Draw a few cells in an accurate, high power diagram and hand in for
assessment.

Why should plants have aerenchyma?

> ***FEEDBACK***: **You will likely be assessed on biological drawing
> from microscope sections in the practical exam. Hand in your drawing
> of the *Juncus* cladode and we will provide feedback. A submission of
> this drawing will count towards your participation mark.**

The classic example of tissue that is both chlorenchyma and aerenchyma
is the spongy mesophyll of many leaves.

**Sclerenchyma**

\(a) *Sclereids*

> \(i) Taste the apple and pear and compare the texture of the two fruits.
> Cut thin sections through the pulp of each fruit. Rinse for 10 minutes,
> then stain with toluidine blue for 5 minutes, rinse again. Mount in
> glycerine and examine. You may have to squash the pear tissue. (When
> squashing a section on a slide, wrap the slide in a tissue and press
> gently but firmly with your thumb - taking care to avoid twisting - and
> not breaking the cover-slip.)

Can you explain the difference in texture in cellular terms?

Draw a small (no more than 5) group of sclereids accurately.

Again determine wall thickness, chemical composition of the wall and
whether the contents are living or not. Locate the pits by careful
focusing using high power.

Do both fruits have sclereids? What might be the possible functional
significance of such cells in a fruit?

> \(ii) Cut a section of the *Hakea* leaf provided. Where are the
> sclereids? What is their staining reaction with toluidine blue and what
> inference can you draw about wall composition? What do you need to do in
> order to confirm that these are indeed sclereids and not fibres?

\(b) *Fibres*

> \(i) Examine the leaves of *Lomandra longifolia* Notice how hard and
> stiff they are. Hard leaves contain large numbers of fibres and are
> often termed sclerophylls. Cut free hand sections across the leaf with a
> razor blade to determine the distribution of fibres. Stain with
> toluidine blue, rinse, mount in glycerine and examine.

The fibres occur in groups on either side of the vascular bundles to
form leaf ridges. The lignin in their walls stains bright blue with
toluidine blue. Determine wall thickness, composition, nature of
contents etc. and draw if you have time.

> \(ii) Now cut sections at right angles to your previous ones, ie.
> paradermal, to obtain an LS through a fibre bundle and stain as above.
> What is the relationship between the length and width of these fibres?
> Which of those cell types you have studied today are the fibres most
> like and in what important ways do they differ from these?

PLANT CELLS: SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES

Various different types of cells are found in the mature plant body.
Each performs a specific function. In the practical classes you will be
looking at a range of different plant tissues and you will be expected
to be able to identify the major cell types. The notes given below
should help to clarify the important features of each type.

*PARENCHYMA*

In herbaceous plants 80% of the plant body is composed of parenchyma.
The term parenchyma is used for tissues composed of *living* cells
generally having *thin wholly primary walls* and a *polyhedral shape*
(generally but not always isodiametric) (See Fig. 2.1). [A wall is said
to be wholly primary if the thickening of the wall is completed before
the cell has reached its full size, any thickening laid down after the
cell has reached its full size is said to be secondary.] Parenchyma is
the main representative of the ground tissue system: this forms a
continuous tissue in all major plant organs, e.g., cortex of roots, pith
and cortex of stems, ground tissue of petioles and mesophyll of leaves.
Parenchyma cells also occur as components of complex tissue systems
(such as xylem and phloem) either scattered singly or aggregated.
Generally parenchyma is unlignified but lignified parenchyma can occur,
particularly as a component of xylem. A number of types of parenchyma
can be recognised including:

> **chlorenchyma**: parenchyma containing chloroplasts, found in leaves,
> outsides of stems and rarely in certain specialized roots;
>
> **storage parenchyma**: contains stored food reserves, most commonly
> starch grains but other reserves also occur such as sucrose, inulin
> etc.; may be found throughout the plant or concentrated in special
> storage organs such as tubers, rhizomes, storage roots etc.;
>
> **aerenchyma**: parenchyma in which the cells have extended processes
> so increasing the amount of intercellular air space in the tissue.
> Found in some leaves, e.g., *Ananas* (pineapple), *Canna*, some stems,
> e.g., *Juncus*, and the roots of many plants from waterlogged
> habitats.

*COLLENCHYMA*

Collenchyma is a living tissue composed of more or less elongated cells
with thick, non-lignified primary walls (see Fig 2.1). It is the main
supporting tissue in the leaves and stems of many dicotyledons, for
example in the midrib and petiole of leaves and in strands in the outer
cortex of stems (often forming ridges). Collenchyma is well adapted to
function as support tissue in growing organs, as it combines high
tensile strength with considerable plasticity. Unlike sclerenchyma it is
extensible. The cell walls are made of cellulose, hemicellulose and
pectin and normally stain a very bright pink with toluidine blue and are
considered to be primary. *The wall material is deposited unevenly and
is particularly thick at cell corners* - a good diagnostic feature in
TS.

With age, the cells of collenchyma may, in some species become lignified
and therefore the tissue changes into sclerenchyma.

*SCLERENCHYMA*

Sclerenchyma refers to a tissue composed of cells with thick, rigid,
secondary walls (usually but not always lignified) whose function is
support and/or protection; frequently the cells lack protoplasts at
maturity. Many different cell types are involved but two major groups
are recognized: fibres and sclereids.

**Fibres**: are long tapered interlocking cells, normally unbranched.
Typically without protoplasts at maturity and with obscure simple
pitting; frequently, but not always, lignified (unlignified fibres are
most often associated with phloem). Fibres may occur singly or in groups
and are often associated with vascular tissue (see Fig.2.2).

Fibres produced by plants have been used commercially for centuries. At
present, plants from 44 different families are used as sources of fibre.
Common commercial fibres may be divided into textile fibres including
flax (*Linum usitatissimum*) jute (*Corchorus* spp.), hemp (*Cannabis
sativa* - yes it does have a legitimate use!) and ramie (*Boehmeria
nivea*), and cordage fibres, including sisal (*Agave sisalana*),
bowstring hemp (*Sansevieria* spp.) and New Zealand flax (*Phormium
tenax*). Extraction of most fibres is by a process called "retting".
This decomposes the middle lamellae between cells so that they separate.
The plant material is left in water while decomposition occurs, then
dried and passed between rollers which separates the fibres from the
outer tissue.

Bast is the name given to the fibres associated with phloem in various
smooth barked trees, most notably the lime (*Tilia* spp.). This was
formerly stripped from trees to make a coarse fabric.

**Sclereids**: These vary greatly in shape. They differ from fibres in
that they do not have a very elongated simple shape. Usually they have
very thick secondary walls with obvious pits and are strongly lignified
(see Fig. 2.2). Often classified on the basis of shape, but according to
Esau (1977), this is of limited use because the various forms
intergrade. These cells, individually or in groups are widely
distributed in the plant body, but are particularly common in leaves,
fruits and seeds.

*XYLEM VESSELS and TRACHEIDS*

Xylem is a complex tissue, composed of conducting (or tracheary)
elements, fibres and parenchyma.

Conducting elements are of two kinds, **tracheids** and **vessel
members**. Both are elongated cells, thick walled and without living
contents at maturity. The secondary wall is laid down in various
patterns and usually becomes lignified.

**Tracheids** originate from single cells, are normally elongated and
pointed at both ends and are imperforate, i.e., pit closing membranes
being present in the region of pits. Tracheids are present in all
divisions of vascular plants (and were present in all fossil groups of
vascular plant as well) and are the only tracheary elements in
pteridophytes and gymnosperms.

**Vessels** consist of chains of cells in a longitudinal file. They are
present in the wood of nearly all angiosperms. In each file of cells the
transverse end walls are perforated so that the lumens of adjacent cells
are in continuity. Each 'cell' is known as a **vessel member**. Although
vessel members are very short, vessels may be several centimetres long
in some species.

Xylem elements which differentiate during early phases of growth,
usually have a thin primary wall with rings or helices of secondary wall
thickening deposited on it. These 'annular' (Fig. 2.2A) or 'helical'
(Fig. 2.2 B & C) xylem elements are extensible and often become very
much stretched during the elongation of the organ in which they occur so
that the thickenings become more widely spaced. Later formed elements
have more extensive regions of secondary wall thickening and are not
extensible. These are 'reticulate' (Fig. 2.2 D & E) or
'pitted'(Fig.2.2E) elements.

*PHLOEM*: sieve tubes and companion cells.

Phloem is a complex tissue comprising sieve tubes, companion cells,
parenchyma, fibres and sclereids. The transporting elements are called
the sieve elements. These are of two kinds, **sieve cells** (which occur
in pteridophytes and gymnosperms) and **sieve tubes** which occur in
angiosperms.

**Sieve cells** are elongated cells with special sieve areas in lateral
and occasionally terminal walls.

**Sieve tubes** are longitudinal files of cells, each of which is called
a **sieve tube member**. In these cells the sieve areas in the
transverse walls are specialised and form a **sieve plate** (see Fig.
2.3). This is a porous region of the wall through which the protoplasts
of adjacent sieve tube members interconnect.

Mature sieve elements have living contents (protoplasts) although they
usually lack normal nucleus. They are usually closely associated with
**companion cells** (see Fig. 2.3). (These both originate by division of
the same cell.) Companion cells are elongated cells with living contents
including large nuclei and dense cytoplasm. From one to several
companion cells are associated with each sieve element and it is thought
that there is a close functional relationship between them, but the
precise function of companion cells is controversial.

Reference: Raven, P.H., Evert, R.F. & Eichhorn, S.E. 2013. **The Biology
of Plants 8^th^ edition** pp 478-492.

In this practical, we will examine the floral characters of typical
angiosperms. In addition, we will introduce you to sufficient
terminology that you can use identification keys based on reproductive
characters.

Adaptation of floral structure to a wide variety of pollination
mechanisms has produced a vast array of different flowers. Analysing
these differences is basic to identification of angiosperms. Since full
descriptions are difficult to write and tedious to read, and most of us
are not artistic enough to make accurate drawings of flowers, short-hand
methods of recording some of the important features have been developed.

***PREPARATION***

Before the class, read the following section on recording floral
structure and examine the diagrams supplied in this manual.

Make sure you can distinguish between the following sets of terms
(consult the glossary at the back of the manual):

determinate and indeterminate growth

radial and bilateral symmetry

perianth, petal, corolla, sepal, calyx

ovary, ovule and ovum

carpel and gynoecium

***METHODS OF RECORDING FLORAL STRUCTURE***

As you will see, flowers are complex, highly specialised, and exhibit
tremendous morphological diversity across taxa. Botanists have a number
of ways of describing floral structure.

**(a) A floral formula** can express the number, fusion and insertion of
floral parts.

> The symbols used are as follows:-
>
> **K** : calyx (sepals)
>
> **C** : corolla (petals)
>
> **P** refers to the perianth, when calyx (**K**) and corolla (**C**)
> are not different.
>
> **A** : androecium i.e. the number and arrangement of stamens and
> staminodes.
>
> **G** : gynoecium i.e. the number and arrangement of carpels.
>
> **G** *4* : a line under the number for G indicates a superior ovary
>
> **G** 3 : a line over the number for G indicates an inferior ovary
>
> **\*** : radially symmetric flower ie. actinomorphic
>
> .|. : bilaterally symmetric flower ie. zygomorphic
>
> \(5) signifies fusion of parts in the same whorl;
>
> [C5+A5] or C5+A5 indicates fusion between the parts of different
> whorls.
>
> for example, the floral formula \* K5 [C(5) A5+5] G(*3*)

signifies a radially symmetrical flower with 5 free sepals, 5 fused
petals, 2 whorls each of 5 stamens that arise from the inside of the
petals, and 3 fused carpels with a superior ovary.

Cut a longitudinal section through a flower to determine whether the
ovary is superior or inferior. Cut a cross section through the basal
part of the flower through the ovary to determine the number and
arrangement of the carpels (locules). Then gently squeeze each section
of the ovary. If the ovules pop out of one end then you can assume that
they must be attached at the other end.

(b) **A floral diagram** is a ground plan that can express number of
    parts, fusion and some of the symmetry, but not whether the ovary is
    superior or inferior. It helps to draw concentric circles for each
    whorl first in light pencil as a guide for the diagram. The position
    of the inflorescence axis and the subtending bract or leaf can also
    be shown. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show examples of floral diagrams and
    floral formulae

> **Fig.3.1** A floral diagram of *Flindersia*, a rainforest tree of
> northern NSW. Note that each successive whorl is offset by the same
> angle. This alternation of whorls is a feature of virtually all
> flowers. There is an outer whorl of fertile stamens (the five lobed
> anthers between the petals) and an inner whorl of sterile staminodes
> (the five circles opposite the petals). Fusion is shown by joining
> parts with a line (as for the sepals). Note that the petals are shown
> to overlap, the stamens in the inner whorl are reduced and sterile,
> and the 5 locules show axile placentation. These points are not
> indicated in the formula.

**Fig 3.8** Sections of the ovary of two related species, both members
of the Agavaceae. In *Agave*, the vascular traces to the whorls of
perianth and stamens can be identified in the outer layers of the ovary
tissue.

***INFLORESCENCES***

Species in which the flowers arise singly in the axil of leaves on
ordinary vegetative branches are usually considered to have the
primitive flower arrangement. Mostly, specialised flowering branches
called inflorescences are produced. There is considerable variation in
the pattern in which flowers are borne on inflorescences. The more an
inflorescence differs from an ordinary vegetative branch, the more
highly evolved it is usually considered.

> \(a) The inflorescence on *specimen A* is said to be *anthotelic* (ending
> in a flower), because the growing apex of the inflorescence axis is used
> up to form a flower, and subsequent growth is from lateral branches. The
> pattern of branching and the length of the internodes within the
> inflorescence are used to define sub-types (see Fig 3.9). Which sub-type
> of the anthotelic inflorescence is this?
>
> \(b) *Specimen B* has a *blastotelic* inflorescence (ending in a branch
> or vegetative bud). The apical bud of the inflorescence axis is not used
> to form a flower, and so the inflorescence is potentially indeterminate:
> ie. it could continue to grow indefinitely. Hence these inflorescences
> often do not have such a precisely defined size as anthotelic ones. When
> the axis of the inflorescence reverts back to vegetative growth at the
> end of the flowering season, the inflorescence becomes *intercalary*
> rather than *terminal* on the plant (ie. within a branch, rather than on
> the end of a branch). Which of the sub-types of the blastotelic
> inflorescence is this (see Fig 3.9)?
>
> \(c) A mixture of branching patterns may occur within the one
> inflorescence. These are described in order of branching eg. a raceme of
> cymes - the cyme is the terminal form (Fig 3.9). Describe the
> inflorescence in specimens *C,* *D* and *E*. Record each in the form of
> a line diagram, as in Fig 3.9. Note carefully whether the flowers are
> sessile or have a peduncle.

**Fig 3.9** Types of inflorescences. The sequence in which the flowers
open is indicated by size of the circles representing the flowers;
largest opens first, smallest opens last.

***PLANT IDENTIFICATION***

**1. Examine the floral structure of the specimen provided.**

> \(a) **Perianth.** How many whorls of perianth are present? If there is
> more than one whorl, do they alternate in position as in Fig 3.1? Are
> they differentiated into calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals)?
>
> How many parts are present in each whorl?
>
> Are the petals free from the base or are they fused into a tube? Do
> they arise
>
> from the base of the ovary or from above the ovary? Is the ovary
> **superior** or **inferior** (see Fig. 3.3)? Would you describe the
> flower as hypogynous, epigynous or perigynous?
>
> \(b) **Androecium.** Does the number of stamens relate readily to the
> number in each perianth whorl, or is it very large and variable from
> flower to flower? Can you determine a constant number of stamens for the
> flower?
>
> Do the stamens arise from a rim-like extension of the receptacle at
> the top of the ovary by individual stalks, from the top of a staminal
> tube formed by fusion of the stalks (Fig. 3.3), or from some distance
> up on the inner surface of the petals? The stamens may appear to be
> all on the one whorl, but often we can distinguish inner and outer
> whorls by their position in relation to the petals (see Fig. 3.8).
>
> \(c) **Symmetry.** Study the symmetry of the flower from above. Is there
> more than one axis of symmetry? Are the parts of each whorl all of the
> same size? What type of symmetry is shown: **radial** or **bilateral**?
>
> \(d) **Gynoecium.** Note the single style arising in the centre of the
> flower. The structure of the ovary is often seen more clearly in
> developing fruits. Cut the ovary transversely with a razor blade and
> examine the cut surface with a hand lens. Make certain you have cut
> through the centre of the ovary, and not above or below it. You should
> be able to see several ovule-containing regions (**locules**) separated
> by thin radial walls. The ovules will appear to radiate from the
> **placenta**. Otherwise, if you gently squeeze the ovary, the ovules
> will pop up from the surface, but some will remain attached to the
> placenta. Is the placenta on the outer wall or at the centre of the
> ovary? How many locules and placentas are there? Use this information to
> determine the number of carpels in the gynoecium.
>
> Is the flower **apocarpous** or **syncarpous** (see Fig. 3.6)? Which

>
> Now determine the position of the locules in relation to the other

>
> flower. Does the centre of each locule lie opposite a sepal or in
> between two sepals (ie., opposite a petal)? Note the pattern of
> alternating whorls of floral parts (sepals, petals, stamens and
> carpels).
>
> \(e) **Floral diagram.** Draw enough concentric circles for the whorls of
> perianth and stamens, making the diameter of the inner one at least 4 cm
> so as to leave plenty of room in the centre to draw in the gynoecium
> later. Draw in the perianth on the outer whorls, following the most
> appropriate example in Figs 3.1 & 3.2.
>
> Draw in the stamens as lobed anthers (to distinguish them from sterile
>
> **staminodes**; Fig. 3.1), making certain to position each stamen
> correctly with respect to the perianth members. If the stamens are
> fused with the perianth, join the anther to the appropriate perianth
> part (inner or outer) by a straight line (see Fig. 3.2B).
>
> Draw the gynoecium in the centre of your floral diagram. Use **two
> lines,** one for
>
> the outer wall of the ovary and another for the walls that divide the
> locules. Show some ovules attached to the placenta in each locule of
> the ovary (see Fig 3.1).

(f) Cut a second flower of the specimen vertically along a diameter that
    divides the flower symmetrically. Note how the ovary is positioned
    in the flower with respect to the receptacle and point of attachment
    of the stamens, etc. Would you describe the flower as
    **hypogynous**, **perigynous** or **epigynous** (see Fig 3.3)?

> \(g) Now summarize the floral structure in a floral formula.

**Plant Identification and Family Descriptions**

We will examine the key traits and features of some of the **major
Australian plant families** throughout this course. Details for these
families are provided in the back of the lab manual (Plant
Identification and Family Descriptions, and the Key to Australian Plant
Families).

PRAC 4 (WEEK 5): LEAVES

Reference: Raven, P.H., Evert, R.F. & Eichhorn, S.E. 2013. **The Biology
of Plants 8^th^ edition**. pp 592-604.

Although leaves are all constructed to a basic plan, they vary greatly
in physiognomy, morphology and internal arrangement of tissues.

You will be familiar with the textbook dorsiventral mesomorphic leaf
from First Year Biology. While this type of leaf features in all
textbooks, it is relatively rare in nature. Most species have leaves
modified in some way from this basic pattern. Syndromes of modifications
are often correlated with particular environments and are therefore
interpreted as being of adaptive significance.

In this practical we will look at leaves from plants from different
environments and representing different leaf forms and life histories.
*We are trying a new approach to comparing variation in plant form and
function – very high resolution images stored as digital files. This
approach allows us to examine microscopic images without using
microscopes. *

Each digital file (save for one section of a primitive plant) in today’s
prac is of transverse leaf sections.

1)  **The evolution of specialisation in leaf tissue.**

We have specimens of *Psilotum* (a seedless vascular plant), *Pinus* (a
conifer), and many flowering plants (e.g. *Hibbertia scandens*). Open
each of these three images.

*Psilotum* and *Pinus* represent an evolutionary jump in the
specialisation of photosynthetic tissue (from a green photosynthesising
stem to a specialised needle leaf).

*Is there any evidence that* Pinus *leaves are more specialised for
photosynthesis than* Psilotum *stems?*

*Photosynthetic stems are required to support the plant as well as
photosynthesise. Are support cells present in* Psilotum *stems that are
not seen in* Pinus *stems? If so, why is the presence of these support
cells problematic for photosynthesis?*

*Do* Pinus *leaves have more specialised cell types than* Psilotum
*stems?*

Compare the *Pinus* leaf to the angiosperm *Hibbertia scandens* leaf.

*Are the parenchyma cells arranged differently in the two leaf types?
Are there more specialised cell types or arrangements in angiosperm
leaves? *

1)  **Adaptations to arid environments**

Leaves are a primary source of water loss in plants. Many Australian
plants have to deal with regular droughts or consistently arid
environments. As a consequence, these plants express many adaptations
limit water loss. Open the images for each of the plants in the table
below and list the adaptations to limit water loss.

*Student Name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*

  **Species**           **Adaptation to limit water loss**

  *Banksia serrata*     
  *Correa alba*         
  *Hakea teretifolia*   
  *Atriplex* sp         

**3. Tradeoffs in leaf form and function**

Open the file for *Helianthus* sp (*Helianthus* are the sunflowers) and
compare the leaf form to the leaf form of plants adapted to water
limitation.

Helianthus *are some of the fastest growing plants in the world. Through
your observations on the leaf sections, could you predict that*
Helianthus *is probably a faster growing species than the species
adapted to water limitation? *

*What do your comparisons of leaf form tell you about the tradeoffs in
leaf function? *

**4. Leaf form in *Eucalyptus***

Open the file for *Eucalyptus* sp.

*How do* Eucalyptus *leaves differ from most of the other angiosperm
leaves we looked at today? Why might this leaf form be an advantage for
Eucalypts?*

4.  *Rainforest tree leaves*

> Rainforests historically dominated much of Australia, and small
> patches of rainforest are a feature of high conservation value down
> the east coast of Australia today. According to textbooks, the leaves
> of rainforest plants are, by definition, not scleromorphic or

When the class data have been assembled study the completed table and
compare these to your observations on leaves of arid environments. Is it
possible to recognise a general suite of features of leaves of
rainforest plants?

PRAC 5 (WEEK 6): SALT TOLERANCE **

**AND TRANSPORT **

**1. SALT MARSH PLANTS AND VIRTUAL MICROSCOPY**

Unlike most animal tissue, many plant tissues can be hand sectioned
without a prior need to fix the material beforehand. To make permanent
slides, fixation embedding and sectioning with a microtome and staining
is required, but hand sections still have a place in modern botany. A
quickly prepared hand section may be useful for identification purposes,
or to provide indications that a more detail investigation could be
profitable. It is not our intention that virtual microscopy replace wet
lab classes – learning the skills of hand sectioning is not something we
want to abolish. We see the major advantage of virtual microscopy is
that it broadens the range of material available for a class. After, for
example, making hand section of a leaf of one species, and observing its
features, the class will be able to study images of sections of other
species with adaptations to particular environments.

We do not wish to be presumptive in the use of particular images. We
might use a particular image to illustrate a certain feature, but there
may be other features which you could use for some different purpose.
(Indeed we would be pleased to learn of other features which could be of
interest).

Plants are three dimensional. One of the skills that we try to impart is
the interpretation of slides in three dimensions. Thus in the standard
textbook interpretation of the TS of dicot leaf, the palisade mesophyll
appears as if it were a solid wall, whereas a paradermal section reveals
the presence of, admittedly narrow, air spaces around each palisade
cell. (Indeed, as the diffusion of CO~2~ through water is 10,000 times
slower than in air, photosynthesis would be very much impaired if the
air spaces weren’t there). Interpretation of sections of secondary wood
also requires a three dimensional perspective.

Not every section of the same material will be identical – on the basis
of a single section it might easily be concluded, for example, that a
species doesn’t have salt glands. In the sections of *Frankenia* leaf
salt glands are seen in some, but are absent in others. In some sections
they are on the adaxial side of the leaf, in others the abaxial. This
variation reflects the density and distribution of glands – similar
variation is shown in many other features. It is dangerous to leap to
conclusions on the basis of a single section.

i.  Leaf Sections

-   Examine the section of the leaf of *Spinifex*. This is a plant that
    grows in the fore dunes around much of the Australian coast.

What cells are responsible for the leaf rolling up under dry conditions?
How is rolling achieved?

Rolling of leaves is said to be an adaptation to drought as the stomata
are protected by the moist still air trapped inside the rolled up leaf.

-   Do you think this is demonstrated by *Spinifex*? If not, why not?

i.  *Spartina anglica*

This is one of the world’s worst weeds, invading mudflats in many
locations, including southern Australia.

![](media/image13.jpeg)

Is Spartina a C~3~ or a C~4~ species?

-   Draw a HP drawing showing those features of the leaf which support
    your conclusion.

<!-- -->

-   Where are the stomata in *Spartina*?

i.  *Sporobolus virginicus*

*Sporobolus virginicus* is a major saltmarsh grass around the world.

![](media/image14.jpeg)

One of its adaptations to tolerating saline conditions is through
excretion of salts through special salt glands. In grasses, salt glands
are relatively simple two celled structures.

In *S. virginicus* most of the glands are on the upper surface of the
leaf, and can be hard to distinguish from protuberances on the
epidermis, but the lower of the two cells is large and has dense
cytoplasm.

-   Locate and draw a salt gland in the section.

-   Is *S. virginicus* a C~3~ or C~4~ species?

i.  *Frankenia*

*Frankenia* is a small sub-shrub. Species of *Frankenia* are found on
the upper edge of saltmarshes, or in saline semi-desert areas. There are
a number of species in Australia.

-   Examine the sections of TS of *Frankenia* leaf.

-   What features of the leaf suggest adaptation to dry conditions?

-   Locate and draw a salt gland.

-   Do all the sections show salt glands? Why may there be variation
    between sections?

i.  *Samolus repens*

*Samolus* is a cosmopolitan genus of wetland plants. In Australia *S.
repens* is widespread in a range of coastal wetlands, including
saltmarshes.

-   Examine the TS sections of leaf and stem, and the paradermal leaf
    section.

-   Locate the salt glands. Note that glands are also found in stems.

-   Use the information in the TS and paradermal leaf sections to
    produce a 3D drawing of a salt gland.

i.  Examine the demonstration material of hydathodes in *Impatiens* sp.

**2. Stem Transport**

In this prac, we will compare aspects of xylem architecture between
Angiosperms and non-flowering plants, and the relationship between
drought tolerance and xylem architecture across Angiosperm species.

We are currently assembling the species to be used in this prac and will
provide a worksheet on the day of the prac.

There will be exercises on plant identification this week. Complete the
exercises for identifying plant families using the key / identification
and family descriptions of the major Australian plant families.

**PRAC 6 (WEEK 7):** **ROOT STRUCTURE & FUNCTION **

Reference: Raven et al. 2013. **The biology of plants, 8^th^** edition,
ch 24.

**Introduction **

Plants invest significant amounts of the carbon captured in
photosynthesis in their root systems. Roots not only anchor and support
plants but they are also pervasive systems which form an extensive
interface with the soil. Although the branching patterns and size of
roots vary greatly with different species and in different conditions,
the morphology and anatomy of all root systems is fundamentally similar.

The basic structure of all roots is similar to that of a primary root
covered in the first year course (BIOS 1101, session 2). We will assume
that you have remembered this knowledge. Otherwise the reference above
will help.

Since all roots have an essentially similar plan we will focus mostly on
root specialisations which enhance root survival and nutrient
acquisition.

First we will examine how lateral branches are produced. They are
ENDOGENOUS - that is, in contrast to stems, they are initiated deep
inside root tissues.

**1. The initiation of lateral roots.**

Lateral roots are initiated early in development in broad beans (*Vicia
faba*). Cut transverse sections of root tissue through a young emerging
lateral root and down the root where no lateral root has yet emerged and
stain with toluidine blue.

a\) From which tissues are lateral roots initiated?

> b\) By what mechanism do lateral roots penetrate the cortex?

c)  How soon does a lateral become ‘root-like’, with a root cap etc.?

d)  Is the lateral at emergence identical to the main root apex? Look at
    > the demonstration of prepared slides of the main root apex in L.S.

**2. When is a root not a root?**

> Aerial roots are an example of specialised roots. Here we will examine
> the pneumatophores - aerial roots that emerge from the mud in mangrove
> swamps.
>
> Use the following questions to conduct an investigative exercise into
> the differences between mangrove pneumatophores and a typical primary
> root.

a)  Is there an obvious root cap?

a.  What happens when the root tip emerges from the mud?

c.  What is the primary function of a pneumatophore? What adaptations do
    > pneumatophores have that allow them to carry out this function?

**PRAC 7 (WEEK 8): VASCULAR TISSUE, AND STEM STRUCTURE AND SECONDARY
THICKENING IN DICOTYLEDONS **

**1. VASCULAR TISSUE**

References : Raven et al. (2013) ch 25-26

The cells involved in long distance transport invariably occur together
in the same region of a stem or root. There are two systems: xylem,
involved in water transport and phloem, in sugar (usually sucrose)
transport. Collectively these are known as vascular tissue.

In stems xylem and phloem occur together in vascular bundles, which are
distributed either in a ring (dicotyledons) or scattered throughout
(monocotyledons). In contrast in roots, they occur in the centre as a
stele. The system is continuous throughout the plant and extends into
the leaves as the major and minor veins.

The purpose of today's lab is to demonstrate the features of the types
of cells that are found in xylem and phloem, so that these may be
considered in relation to their role in transport.

VASCULAR CESLLS AND TISSUE

*Xylem tissue comprise the following*: *Phloem contains*:

vessels } transporting cells sieve tubes } transporting cells

tracheids sieve cells

parenchyma companion cells

fibres parenchyma

fibres

The dye toluidine blue is very useful in differentiating between xylem
and phloem. Vessels, tracheids, fibres and sometimes also the xylem
parenchyma contain lignin in their walls, which will therefore stain
bright blue or green. In contrast, the only cells in the phloem that are
lignified are the fibres. Walls of sieve tubes, sieve cells and
companion cells, which are not lignified usually stain a bright purple.

Apart from this, there are also important structural differences that
distinguish the transporting cells in these two tissue types and the
purpose of this lab is to investigate these.

**XYLEM**: tracheids and vessel elements

The transporting cells of the xylem are modified into either vessel
elements or tracheids. In addition, xylem contains fibres and xylem
parenchyma (which may or may not be lignified). The basic distinction
between tracheids and vessel elements is that the tracheid is an
imperforate cell while the end walls of vessel elements are perforated.

**2. SECONDARY THICKENING **

The primary growth of the stem is laid down by the **procambium**. In
dicots the vascular tissue is arranged in a cylinder near the periphery
of the stem, with the primary xylem inside the primary phloem. Secondary
growth results from activity of the **vascular cambium,** a lateral
meristem that is derived from the procambial layer between the primary
xylem and phloem. This layer is meristematic, i.e. it retains the
capacity to divide. Derivatives of the vascular cambium give rise to
**secondary xylem** internally and **secondary phloem** externally. Both
these secondary tissues include **rays** that facilitate radial
transport and which are also formed by divisions of the vascular
cambium.

A.  ***Secondary growth in herbaceous plants***

Many herbaceous plants have a limited amount of secondary growth in the
older and slightly woody parts of the plant. A study of *Coleus* will
help you to revise primary stem structure in the dicot, and illustrate
the early stages of vascular cambial activity.

a.  Cut thin transverse sections through an internode in *Coleus* from
    about the middle of plant. Stain with toluidine blue and mount in
    glycerine. Note the following features in the section:

<!-- -->

i.  Epidermis and cortex (indicate types of cells present).

> ii\) The wider parts of the vascular cylinder which contain the original
> primary
>
> vascular bundles, (primary phloem and primary xylem).
>
> iii\) A continuous ring of vascular cambium (small block-shaped
> thin-walled cells) that
>
> can be divided into those parts formed from procambium within the
> primary vascular bundles (the **fascicular cambium**) and those parts
> extending between the bundles and which were formed by
> de-differentiation of parenchyma (**interfascicular cambium**).

iv. Whether any periderm is forming in the cortex?

> v\) The location of protoxylem with respect to the metaxylem. Is the
> development of
>
> the primary xylem **endarch** or **exarch** in this stem?
>
> b\) Examine the fascicular cambium (within a bundle). In *Coleus* and
> most herbaceous dicots the fascicular cambium gives rise to some
> secondary xylem and secondary phloem, even when externally there is no
> obvious thickening of the stem. Distinguish the boundary between the
> primary and secondary xylem. Note the scattered large empty vessel
> elements in the secondary xylem. What other cell types are present?
>
> c\) Now examine the interfascicular cambium (between the bundles). In
> many species this produces similar secondary xylem. In *Coleus*,
> however, the interfascicular cambium produces a regular tissue devoid of
> vessels. Are the walls of these cells lignified? Do the cells contain a
> protoplast? What sort of cell do you think is forming the
> interfascicular regions of the secondary xylem? What do you think this
> region of the secondary xylem contributes to the stem in a functional
> sense?

d.  Draw a high power drawing of 2-3 cells from the interfascicular
    region of the vascular cambium, together with 2 cells on either side
    of each cambial initial (ie., a strip 2-3 cells wide and 5 cells
    deep)

**B. *Secondary growth in woody plants***

Activity of the cambium enables long life, by renewal of vascular
tissue, as well as increase in size of the plant, by strengthening the
stem. Secondary growth, both of vascular tissue and of periderm (cork),
may be relatively continuous or seasonal.

1.  *Morphology*

> Examine the leaf-bearing branch of the Camphor Laurel (*Cinnamomum
> camphora* ) and note the obvious increase in thickness of stem with
> age. Note that this species develops winter-buds protected by bud
> scales (modified leaves that never expand or become photosynthetic).
> The buds expand to form a new section of stem bearing photosynthetic
> leaves each spring, the bud scales falling away to leave a cluster of
> scars. Hence the past positions of the winter buds can be determined
> by looking for these clusters of scars, and the length of stem between
> the groups of scars corresponds to one year’s growth. It is therefore
> possible to date any part of the stem by counting the number of
> winter-bud positions between that point and the apical bud.
>
> Note that there is still no sign of bark development even on the
> thicker part of this branch. The outer surface is still the smooth
> epidermis with green cortex beneath.

By what factor has the diameter of the stem increased over the initial
primary (first year) stem at its thickest point? By what factor must the
epidermis have expanded?

> What processes must have accommodated this increase?

Secondary thickening in dicots is due to lateral meristem activity: ie.
the vascular cambium and the cork cambia.

**ARBORESCENCE IN MONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS **

Arborescent plants are those with a tree-like form or ‘habit’.
Requirements for arborescence are a method of strengthening the stem in
order to hold the leaves at a greater height, and an increased
conducting capacity (especially of xylem for water transport). We have
already examined the typical form of arborescence in the woody
dicotyledons, where a set of lateral cambia (vascular and cork cambia)
add additional tissues to the primary stem.

The monocotyledons are a class of the Angiosperms which share
characteristic features such as scattered vascular bundles, parallel
venation and sheathing leaf bases. They do not develop the typical
dicotyledonous vascular cambium. The majority of monocotyledons are
herbaceous, but there are a few groups which can grow quite tall with
thickened stems, e.g. bamboos, palms, grass trees (*Xanthorrhoea*),
screw palms (*Pandanus*). The strategy used to achieve a sufficiently
robust stem varies widely between groups.

In this lab we are examining the mechanisms by which the arborescent
stem is produced in the Bangalow Palm (*Archontophoenix cunninghamiana)*

1.  Examine the specimen of *Archontophoenix cunninghamiana* on display.

The young palm has a narrow primary apex which lays down a succession of
leaves separated by internodes that forms a slender stem. As the palm
grows in height, the apex expands to carry an increasing number of
larger leaves, and the internodes already formed expand by cell division
and elongation in the parenchymatous ground tissue between the bundles.
Hence the palm thickens its stem throughout its height as it grows, but
there is no vascular cambium and no addition of extra xylem or phloem.
This process is called ‘sustained primary growth’. There is no new xylem
or phloem produced over the life span of the plant. The seedling palm
lays down very many vascular bundles but only the central ones mature
immediately. The outer bundles remain immature for years and are
differentiated over time as required.

1.  You are provided with sections of parts of young and mature stems of
    the Bangalow Palm, *Archontophoenix cunninghamiana*. All sections
    are taken from the same level in the palm, and so will illustrate
    the developmental changes which occur within an internode from the
    time it is first exposed beneath the crown of the palm until it has
    been thickened in the process of *sustained primary growth*.

Working in pairs, examine the 4 sections provided.

One student should examine young and old sections of the central zone of
the stem.

> a\) Observe in the young central zone sections -
>
> i\) the scattered collateral bundles with *immature* fibre caps but
> mature phloem and metaxylem vessels;
>
> ii\) the compact parenchymatous ground tissue between the bundles.
>
> Score the number of vascular bundles in each of **two separate

> given that the diameter of the X10 field is 2mm, and the area of a

>

b)  Observe in the mature central zone section –

> i\) the matured fibre caps on all bundles;
>
> ii\) the aerenchymatous ground tissue between the bundles.
>

> field?

Enter results and determine by what factor the volume of tissue in the
central zone has

increased?

The other student should examine young and old sections of the outer
zone of the stem.

b)  Observe in the young outer zone section –

> i\) the mature fibre bundles already developed at the periphery of the
> stem;
>
> ii\) the large number of immature vascular bundles in which all cells are

>

**PRAC 9 (WEEK 10): PLANT ALLOMETRY**

Most aspects of plant function are size-dependent. In other words, the
function of plant traits varies in an exponential fashion with plant (or
organ) size. These size-dependent (or allometric) relationships are
central to understanding the nature of plant adaptations and
constraints. In today’s lab, we will examine some important allometric
relationships across plant vegetative and reproductive traits.

In order to examine allometric relationships, data must be collected
from plants across a range of sizes. Each group will be responsible for
collecting data, but we will need data from the entire class.

1.  Adaptive responses to the presence of competitors in *Impatiens
    > wallerana*.

The capacity to respond to competitors is a key adaptation for most
plants (plants rarely grow alone). One common adaptation is the
shade-avoidance response. The shade-avoidance response is induced by the
early detection of competitors. Plants can detect competitors by a
number of mechanisms. For example, green light reflected from the leaves
of competitors is low quality light received by phytochrome receptors in
the chloroplasts. In order to avoid being overtopped by competitors, a
plant will undergo a phenotypic shift to maximise height extension – the
shade-avoidance response.

We been growing *Impatiens wallerana* since early in the session under
two treatments – high density, and individually. High density plants
have been grown with a number of competitors. Record the following data
from the 1-2 randomly high density plants growing in the centre of the
pot (i.e. surrounded by competing plants) and the plants growing
individually in pots:

i)  The diameter of the main stem at ground level (in cm).

ii) The height of the main stem (in cm).

iii) Height / diameter

iv) Total leaf weight (remove all leaves, place in a paper bag, record
    mass).

Using class data – complete the graph and questions on the following
sheet. Check your answers with demonstrators / lecturers

![](media/image17.emf)

1\) What are the average Height / Diameter values for each treatment
(high and low density)? What do these values tell us about how stem
architecture adaptively responds to environmental variability?

2\) On the graph above, plot leaf mass vs stem diameter for all plants.
Use different symbols to plot plants from the high and low density
treatments. Fit a line of best fit (linear or non-linear) through all
data. A) Is the relationship between leaf mass and stem diameter
allometric? B) What is the most likely mechanism behind the above
relationship? C) Based on these results, are there potential costs
associated with adaptive stem architecture (as seen in question 1)?
Continue answer on back of page if you need more room.

2\. Size-dependent reproduction in *Capsella bursa-pastoris*.

Reproductive effort (i.e. proportional allocation to reproduction) is a
major life history trait in plants and animals. In many plant
populations, reproductive effort increases with increasing plant size –
large plants have a higher relative allocation to reproduction than
small plants. We will test for size-dependent reproduction in *Capsella
bursa-pastoris* (shepherd’s purse).

For the individuals of *Capsella bursa-pastoris* provided, a) count the
total number of fruits (including the pedicels and/or dehisced tissue of
fruits that have already matured, and b) put the plant in a paper bag
and record its mass (remember to get the weight of the bag prior to
weighing the plant).

Calculate reproductive effort:

RE = Total number of fruits / Total plant mass.

Using the class data at the front of the lab, calculate the relationship
between RE and plant size.

Is there an allometric relationship between reproductive effort and
plant size?

How should large plants differ from small plants in their relative
contribution of seeds into the next generation? How should natural
selection act on plant sizes in populations where reproductive effort is
size-dependent?

3.  Seed size and dispersal in *Sonchus* sp.

The capacity to disperse offspring into new areas is an important trait
related to fitness and success in plants. Many plant species (like many
*Sonchus*, and many other daisies) employ a pappus (fine hairs on the
fruit or seed) as a parachute. Wind can keep these seeds aloft, allowing
them to travel great distances.

The capacity for a pappus to keep a seed aloft should be strongly
related to seed mass. This sets up an interesting evolutionary tradeoff
– plants that provision their offspring with a large endosperm (large
seeds) are more likely to germinate and survive. Plants with small seeds
are more likely to successfully disperse into new habitats. Of course,
tradeoffs can be quite complex – selection on seed size should be very
strong if there is a allometric relationship between how fast a seed
falls to the ground and its mass. In other words, if large seeds fall to
earth disproportionately fast, then plants employing a wind dispersal
strategy will have strong limits on the size of seeds they can produce.

Here, we will examine the relationship between seed size and dispersal
ability using manipulated *Sonchus* seeds. These seeds are very small
(too small to individually weigh on our balances), so I divided them
into three treatment groups and recorded their average mass.

i)  Control seeds are simply seeds collected from their natural habitat
    (my neighbour’s garden) – average seed mass for these seeds is
    0.0003 g

ii) Large seeds are seeds experimentally coated with a layer of glue –
    average seed mass for these seeds is 0.00045 g. Please note, I don’t
    have many of these seeds (treating them was very difficult), so
    don’t loose them.

iii) Small seeds are seeds with the bottom portion removed – average
    seed mass for these seeds is 0.00025 g.

Tubes have been constructed in the back of the lab. The tubes can be
used to measure the rate seeds differing in mass fall without being
influenced by ambient air currents – they are 1m tall. Drop seeds of
each mass into the tube and record how fast they fall. Convert this to a
value for rate of descent (m/sec). Record your data in the table and
graph at the front of the lab.

Is there an allometric (non-linear) relationship between seed mass and
how fast seeds fall?

What does this say about the seed size evolution in wind dispersed
species? Should seed size limitations control the types of habitats in
which wind dispersed species will be found?

3.  Allometry and fruit size.

Most of the fruits and vegetables we eat are the product of thousands of
generations of artificial selection on traits that are beneficial to us.
For example, the ancestors to most of our fruits are relatively small.
We modified these fruits by using natural variation in fruit traits,
(and, in some cases, fruit trait) mutants to maximise the size and
nutritional quality of our fruits. Any selection (natural or artificial)
acts on variation within populations – traits that limit the fitness of
a genotype will be quickly removed from a population by processes of
natural selection.

Since fruit size is a variable trait within populations, we can predict
that increasing fruit size does not come at a fitness cost to plants. We
will test this prediction using variants of capsicum (*Capsicum annum*).

From each of the capsicum variants, separate the seeds from the non seed
fruit tissue. Put this material in paper bags and weigh the seed and non
seed components. Record the mass of each component on the table and
graph at the front of the lab.

Is there any evidence of allometric relationships between seed mass and
non-seed fruit mass across individuals of capsicum?

What would allometric relationships indicate about our capacity to
develop fruits for agriculture?

**PRAC 10 (WEEK 11): GERMINATION, SEEDS AND FRUITS **

Fruits and seeds play an essential role in the reproduction of most
plants. As well as being reproductive structures they also have
functions in the dispersal of plants, and, in many cases, survival
through periods of adverse conditions. In this practical you will look
at germination in seeds and you are provided with an introduction to
some of the diversity of fruits found in the Angiosperms.

**1**. There are two major modes of germination:

> **Hypogeal**, where the cotyledons remain below the ground and the
> shoot is raised into
>
> the light by elongation of the *epicotyl* (the internode above the
> cotyledons);
>
> **Epigeal**, where the cotyledons emerge above the ground and may
> become the first
>
> photosynthetic organs. (In this case the internode below the
> cotyledons, the *hypocotyl*, elongates.)
>
> Germinated seeds of a number of species are provided. Determine the
> type of germination for each species. Construct a table to indicate
> mode of germination, primary storage area and persistence of
> cotyledons for the species provided.
>
> **2**. Compare the nature and type of food reserves in the following:-
>
> \(1) barley (*Hordeum vulgare*)
>
> \(2) tomato (*Lycopersicum esculentum*)
>
> You will need to section the seeds provided (take care, and if
> necessary, support the seed in the carrot provided for sectioning) and
> stain the sections with the following dyes:-
>
> *Sudan Black B*
>
> This is a standard lipid stain.
>
> Lipid bodies, cuticle and the Casparian band of the exodermis stain
> black.
>
> *Amido Black*
>
> Stain freshly cut sections for about 5 minutes. Rinse in distilled
> water.
>
> Mount in glycerol
>
> Protein bodies and other protein-containing areas should stain a deep
> blue-black.
>
> *Toluidine Blue* should be used to stain phosphorus reserves.
>
> *Iodine* stains starch.

3.  Examine the prepared slides of germinated barley.

> What indications are there that mobilisation of the endosperm reserves
> has already begun?
>
> What features of the aleurone layer suggest the role of this tissue?

3.  You are provided with a berry, a drupe and an indehiscent fruit. In
    each case identify the various layers present in the pericarp. What
    was the nature of the ovary from which each of the fruits was
    derived?

**5.** A range of fruits is provided. Using the Key and descriptions try
to identify the type to which each fruit may be assigned.

Determine whether each fruit is a simple, aggregate or multiple fruit.
If simple, try to find

out whether it was the product of a superior or inferior ovary.

Try to determine the number of carpels incorporated into each fruit, and
the placentation of their ovules. For this it may be necessary to start
your investigations by taking a transverse section through the fruit (a
longitudinal section is rarely informative). In many cases fusion and
abortion of parts during development obscures the picture which can only
be resolved if a full developmental sequence from flower to fruit is
available. For example, a coconut is developed from a tricarpellary
ovary in which two of the locules have aborted.

**DESCRIPTIONS OF FRUIT TYPES**

"...it may be right to say that there are as many sorts of fruits as
there are major groupings of genera. This means thousands of kinds, and
indeed, several hundred specialised names have already been proposed;
the result is another specialist language in the babel of science,
through which the student must break."

E.J. Corner 1964 'The Life of Plants'

The strict definition of a *fruit* would be that it is the product of
the post-fertilizaton development of a pistil. However, it is more
convenient to adopt a functional concept and include as part of the
fruit tissues of extra carpellary origin so that the fruit is the
post-fertilization development of the flower. [In some books you will
find fruit containing tissues of extra carpellary origins referred to as
"false fruit". Thus the strawberry (not a berry but an aggregate fruit)
is said to be a false fruit because the fleshy part is derived from the
receptacle. Even the fruits of *Eucalyptus* are sometimes called false
because, derived from a half inferior flower, the cup of the fruit is
extra carpellary. For most purposes making the distinction between true
and false fruits is unnecessary.]

Several classifications of fruit types have been proposed of varying
complexity. The terminology is, unfortunately, not necessarily
consistent between classifications. Many of the names of fruit types
refer to specialised forms produced by particular families; some of
these special types are of great economic importance so that the names
are widely known, many other special names can be conveniently ignored.

An artificial classification of fruits which is widely used would be as
follows:

**Simple fruit:** a fruit derived from a single pistil or from a single
carpel disseminated singly.

**Aggregate fruit:** a fruit derived from many free carpels of a
*single* flower.

**Multiple fruit:** a fruit derived from the carpels of many individual
flowers crowded together on the same axis.

> **DETAILS OF FRUIT TYPES**

*SIMPLE FRUITS*

(fruit derived from a single pistil or from a single carpel disseminated
singly)

> A fruit is **dry** when the pericarp is papery, leathery or woody at
> maturity and **fleshy** if the pericarp becomes succulent or fibrous.
> Dry fruit may be **dehiscent** if the pericarp splits, or opens by
> means of pores, to shed the seeds and **indehiscent** if the pericarp
> does not open.
>
> Fleshy fruits are virtually all indehiscent.

1.  *Dry dehiscent fruits*

> **FOLLICLE** - product of a single superior carpel containing one or
> many seeds and splitting
>
> down one side of the fruit only - e.g. *Telopea* (waratah),
> *Xylomelum* (woody pear).
>
> **LEGUME** - product of a single superior carpel containing many seeds
> and splitting at maturity along both sides (along the carpel margins
> and the median-vein). Dehiscence is often explosive, ejecting the
> seeds. This is the characteristic fruit of the Leguminosae (Fabaceae).
>
> **CAPSULE** - fruit developed from a number of fused carpels which
> open along a number of
>
> sutures or by pores, e.g. *Eucalyptus.* A **siliqua** is the capsule
> characteristic of the Cruciferae (Brassicaceae) - it is a capsule that
> has two valves (from two fused carpels) which separate from a
> persistent central partition (septum) to which the seeds are attached.

2.  *Dry Indehiscent fruits*

> **ACHENE** - product of a single superior carpel with one seed which
> is free from the pericarp except at the placenta, e.g. *Ranunculus*. A
> **cypsela** is an achene derived from an inferior ovary; the term
> appears to be restricted to the Compositae (Asteraceae).
>
> **SAMARA** - a winged achene; the wing is an extension of the pericarp
> and presumably assists in dispersal, e.g. *Fraxinus* (ash). The fruit
> of the sycamore often given as an example of a samara is really a
> schizocarp (q.v.).
>
> **CARYOPSIS** - product of a unilocular, superior ovary with one seed,
> but the wall of the ovary (pericarp) and the seed coat (testa) are
> fused together; characteristic of the family Gramineae.

**NUT** - one-seeded fruit with a hard, woody pericarp, e.g. *Quercus*
(acorn), *Corylus* (hazelnut). Most of the nuts of commerce are not true
nuts but are the seeds or stones of fruits.

**SCHIZOCARP** - usually the product of several joined carpels which
separate when ripe, but each carpel remains indehiscent. Each carpel
contains one seed, free from the pericarp except at the placenta, e.g.
*Geranium*, the *Apiaceae*, *Acer*. The separate segments are called
**mericarps**. In a sense schizocarps are intermediate between dehiscent
and indehiscent fruits.

**LOMENTUM** - formed from a single carpel with many ovules, that
separates into a number of one-seeded sections - found in a number of
Fabaceae.

> 3\. *Fleshy fruits*

**DRUPE** - the pericarp is differentiated into three zones: an outer
*epicarp*, a middle succulent or fibrous *mesocarp* and an inner
lignified *endocarp*; the endocarp and the contained seed(s) form the
*pyrene* (stone). Most commonly formed from a single superior carpel as
in *Prunus* spp. (peaches, cherries, etc.), but multicarpellary origins
occur, e.g. *Lantana* and sometimes the drupe is pseudomonomerous
through abortion, e.g. *Cocos* (coconut).

**BERRY** - pericarp two-layered, lacking the woody endocarp; usually a
many-seeded fruit formed from a number of fused carpels (inferior or
superior), e.g. *Musa* (banana), *Cucurbita* (pumpkin); sometimes
one-seeded, e.g. *Phoenix* (date), (many so-called "berries" -
strawberry, blackberry, raspberry, are not berries). A **POME** is a
particular kind of berry characteristic of certain members of the
Rosaceae (apples, pears) - the five inferior carpels are free on their
inner edges (the hole in the core) and their outer walls and the
enlarged enclosing receptacle forms the flesh of the fruit.

*AGGREGATE FRUITS*

> (fruit derived from many free carpels of a *single* flower, the
> carpels held together by a persistent floral receptacle which itself
> may be elaborated to form a substantial accessory part of the fruit)

1\. *Receptacle tissue not fleshy*, e.g. *Rubus* (raspberry, blackberry)
where the individual fruits are small drupes borne on a non-succulent
receptacle.

2\. *Receptacle tissue fleshy*, e.g. *Fragaria* (strawberry) where the
individual fruits are achenes borne on a succulent receptacle and *Rosa*
(the rose) where the rosehip consists of achenes enclosed in a fleshy
cup-shaped receptale (a *hip*).

*MULTIPLE FRUITS*

> (Syncarps)

**(**fruit derived from many pistils or carpels of *many individual
flowers crowded together on the same inflorescence* axis. The
inflorescence axis and frequently also the basal parts of all floral
segments as well as the floral receptacle and pedicel are necessarily
incorporated in the fruit)

e.g.:*Syncarpia* (Turpentine) has a fruit formed from a fused cyme with
seven capsules. *Ananas* (pineapple) fruit is a number of fused berries
and the axis of the inflorescence (a spike), the bases of the subtending
bract and the flower stalks have all become succulent.

**PRAC 11 (WEEK 12): FLOWERING PLANT DIVERSITY**

In this lab, we will be examining some of the keys to flowering plant
diversity.

The following paragraph is an excerpt from an influential paper (Davies
et al. 2004):

“Charles Darwin described the rapid rise and diversification within the
angiosperms as an ‘abominable mystery.’ Angiosperms are regarded as one
of the greatest terrestrial radiations of recent geological times. The
major lineages originated 130-90 million years ago (mya), followed by a
dramatic rise to ecological dominance 100-70 mya. Approximately 250 000
extant species have been recognised, although estimates vary, and the
final number might be double this. Within the group, sister clades can
differ in species richness over several orders of magnitude. Darwin
attempted to identify a single causal explanation for the rapid
diversification of angiosperms but described his own efforts as
wretchedly poor.”

Many attempts at understanding the diversification of flowering plants
have focused on the evolution of key traits. Biotic or animal
pollination has been proposed to be a key trait promoting the diversity
of flowing plants, probably because this type of reproduction (with some
minor exceptions) is unique to angiosperms.
