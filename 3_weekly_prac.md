# Week 2: Vegetative Morphology & Intro to Keys

## The Nature Of Leaves

Flowering plants are the culmination of just one evolutionary
pathway in vascular plants. This laboratory aims to place them in the
context of the diverse array of vascular plants and trace the evolution
of some basic aspects of their morphology. The first section of this
laboratory aims to illustrate the less specialised organisation of the
plant body found in the non-flowering plants and from which angiosperm
morphology has been derived, while the latter part of the lab introduces
the use of identification keys. The rest of the course concentrates on
the flowering plants, and will consider form and function of the various
organs of this group in more detail.

The purpose of many of the questions in this lab is to encourage you to
look carefully at your material to see what is really there.

Note the increasing specialisation of organs carrying out
photosynthesis. In the earliest plants ordinary cylindrical stems were
the organs of photosynthesis. In later groups some of the features of
stems are still discernible in the leaves: eg. highly divided and
branching in 3 dimensions; indeterminate growth.

The developments of new organs such as axillary buds, and the
specialisation of organs to serve new functions such as aids to
climbing, are also illustrated.

In today's lab we will do a very brief tour of leaves across all the major groups of vascular plants 
from whisk ferns, ferns, gymnosperms, and finishing with the angiosperms.

\newpage

##Division Psilophyta: the whisk ferns

The earliest known vascular plants consisted of a system of cylindrical
axes. The cortical tissues of the above ground parts had stomata and a
cuticle and were photosynthetic, while the epidermis of the underground
parts had no cuticle but produced hair-like outgrowths to aid absorption
of water and minerals. Such plants are only known from the fossil
record, but there are two living genera that approach this simple level
of organisation. These are *Psilotum* and *Tmesipteris*, both native to
Australia.



###Examine *Psilotum nudum*. 

It consists of a stem system bearing small *microphylls*. The stem grows by a single apical "initial" rather than a meristem (a group of initials).

- Examine the branching of the stem. This type of branching, where there is no main axis bearing laterals, is termed **dichotomous**. It is the oldest form of branching in plants, and is still common in the algae.  Can you distinguish a main axis bearing lateral branches, or are all branches of equal size and growth? 

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}


- Determine what, if any, relationship exists between microphyll and branch position. Does this plant have axillary buds? If there are no actual buds, from which point and in what manner do branches form?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}


- Are apical buds present? Check the definition of bud in the glossary.  

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}


- How do you think new aerial stems are produced from below ground?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- What would be the effect of browsing or pruning the tips of the aerial parts of the plant?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

\newpage

## The Ferns

Members of this order have roots, stems and leaves, but the latter are *megaphylls*, and are not homologous with the microphylls of the previous group. In the ferns there is no main root system, the roots being lateral organs borne on the stems (*adventitious* roots).

### Examine *Lygodium scandens*. 
The stem grows horizontally below the surface of the ground (it is a *rhizome*); only
the leaves are visible. Each leaf grows for one year, climbing on other
plants towards the light, but eventually dies back to be replaced by a
new one the next year.

- Do the leaves show determinate or indeterminate growth?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

-  Note the growing apex of a leaf is coiled up to protect the initial
    cell that is responsible for the growth. All fern leaves uncoil at
    the apex like this – why is this adaptive?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

-  Use the drawings in Figs.1.1. and 1.2 to identify the primary and
    secondary leaflets (*pinnae* and *pinnules*), and the primary and
    secondary *rachises*.

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

-  How would you describe the primary branching in the leaf? Is there
    any evidence of dichotomous branching in these leaves?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

-  Note that the veins in the leaflets (pinnules) are in the form of an
    open system where the branches end blindly rather than joining to
    form a net.

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

-  What, if any, part of *Psilotum nudum* would be homologous with the
    leaf of *Lygodium scandens*? Is any organ of the latter homologous
    with the microphylls of the former?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

![Terms for different leaf morphologies](alternateLeafMorphologies.png)

### Examine *Gleichenia* sp. 

Note the small fibrous adventitious roots that arise at any point along the stem, and the large divided (compound) megaphylls. These leaves uncoil during growth.

-  Determine the relationship (if any) between leaf positions and
    branching of the stem. Does this species have axillary buds? How are
    branches initiated in the stem system?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- Use the diagrams in Fig. 1 to determine what type of branching is present in the leaf. How many orders of branching are there in a leaf? Identify the primary, secondary and tertiary rachises.

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

-  Compare a one-year-old leaf with a two-year-old leaf. Is there any
    evidence of indeterminate growth in these leaves?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

-  Examine the apex of the rhizome (underground stem). Does this plant
    have an apical bud? Is there any protection of the growing apex?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

## Gymnosperms

These are seed plants without fruit or flowers. They are thought to have dominated the world's vegetation during the cooler and drier period that followed the Carboniferous.

### Examine *Podocarpus elatus* 

*Podocarpus elatus* (Plum Pine) is a conifer native to the closed forests of eastern Australia. 

The leaves of conifers are also interpreted as megaphylls, i.e. as having evolved from
a lateral branch that has become determinate in growth and flattened to
enhance interception of light.

- Note the simple leaves that characterise the order. Are the leaves strictly determinate in growth? How are they arranged? What term(s) best
 describe the **phyllotaxis** (leaf arrangement)?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- Hold a leaf up against the light and examine the pattern of the veins
 with a hand lens. Can you detect any lateral veins branching from the
 midrib? These leaves have a continuous sheet of tracheid-like cells
 between the adaxial and abaxial mesophyll tissue that distributes water
 laterally through the lamina from the single midvein.

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- Examine the pattern of branching of the stem. Look for axillary buds in leaf axils. Does this plant have axillary branching as in angiosperms or apical
 branching as in ferns?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

 Examine the growing apex closely. Rather than a naked apical meristem, this group has the meristem protected within a bud. Note that the bud consists of a meristem enclosed with embryonic leaves, but that these are themselves enclosed within a group of **bud scales**, ie., reduced and hardened leaves that protect the bud. When the apex starts growing next spring, the bud scales fall off (leaving scars where they were attached) and the new vegetative leaves expand as the stem grows out of the bud. The positions of previous **winter buds** can be seen at intervals down the stem. They appear as rings of scars where the bud scales were attached.

- Given that each winter bud marks the end of a year's growth, how old is the basal internode of the specimen you are examining?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

## Angiosperms -- Flowering Plants

**Fill in the appropriate information in Table 1.1 and 1.2 as you examine the angiosperms in the lab today.**

There are many orders of flowering plants. All are characterised by the
possession of a carpel, pollination at a distance from the micropyle of
the ovule, and double fertilisation via a pollen tube. Like the previous
two divisions their leaves are megaphylls, although there is some
evidence that the megaphyll evolved separately in each group. Unlike
conifers, the leaves of angiosperms may be simple or compound.

###Examine *Abelia triflora* 

Note that it has simple leaves with a short petiole, and that the laminas of these are mostly arranged in the one plane, spreading out either side of the stem. Note carefully how leaves are attached at successive nodes.

-  Which term(s) (see Fig. 1.2) best describes the phyllotaxis (leaf
    arrangement) of Abelia?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}




- Using a hand lens and holding the leaf against the light, examine the
 venation pattern in the leaf lamina.

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}




- Are there any free vein endings in the leaf? Which term best describes
this pattern? How does this pattern differ from that in the leaflet of a fern? 

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}




- Examine the relationship between stems, leaves and branches. How do
    branches arise on the stem? Does this plant have axillary branching?
    Does each leaf axil contain a bud? How can you distinguish a branch
    of Abelia bearing two rows of simple leaves from a single pinnate
    leaf?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}


### Examine the  the pea seedlings (*Pisum sativum*) on your bench. 
    
Each leaf is compound, consisting of a petiole terminating in a rachis bearing several pairs of rounded leaflets.

- Which term(s) best describes the form of these leaves (see Figs. 1.1 and 1.2).

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- Identify the pair of large rounded stipules associated with each
    node, and resembling a basal pair of leaflets that are attached
    directly to the stem. Note how they enclose the apical bud of the
    main axis. What possible adaptive value could these stipules have?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}





-  Which term(s) best describe the phyllotaxis (leaf arrangement - see Figs. 1.1 and 1.2).

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

-  Does this plant have axillary buds?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

### Examine *Acacia elata* (Cedar Wattle).

How much constitutes a leaf? Look for axillary buds that may arise in the axils of leaves, but never in the axils of leaflets. Also look for the largest repeated unit of organisation. The leaf is the largest determinate unit of organisation, as distinct from the indeterminate stem system.

-  Identify the petiole, rachis, primary leaflets (pinnae) and
    secondary leaflets (pinnules). Are the primary and secondary
    leaflets strictly paired? 

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

    
- Is there a terminal leaflet on the primary
    rachis? 

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- Is there a terminal secondary leaflet on the secondary
    rachises? 

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}
    
- Which term(s) best describe the form of these compound
    leaves? (see Fig. 1.2).

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

-  Are there stipules present?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- Look for the doughnut- or volcano-shaped glands (**nectaries**) that
    are a characteristic feature of the petiole and/or the rachis of
    *Acacia* species. What could be the adaptive value of such
    nectaries?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}





- Compare the form of these leaves with those of *Gleichenia*. In
    which respects do they differ? Which of these two forms of leaf most
    closely resembles a stem system? (ie., which is the more primitive
    megaphyll?) Which features of the *Acacia* do you consider to be
    advanced, and which do you consider primitive?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}





### Examine specimens A, B, and C

In some angiosperms the process of adaptation has blurred the
    functional distinction between leaves and stems. Some such examples
    are considered below.

In each of specimens A, B and C, use your knowledge of the
    relationship between stems, leaves and axillary branches to work out
    what constitutes a leaf, and then enter in Table 1.1 the appropriate
    terminology from Fig 1.2 to describe the form and arrangement of the
    leaves.

 In the following cases, some part of the plant has been modified to serve as an aid to climbing.

Examine the **tendrils** on the young pea plants supplied. Each
     tendril arises from near the end of a compound leaf, in the
     position in which you find a leaflet (CHECK THIS) on a leaf that
     has no tendril.

 Hence, we can conclude that the development has been modified so that
 the tissues that normally develop into the leaflet grow into a tendril
 instead (ie., the tendril is a modified leaflet/pinna).

 Now examine the tendrils on the branch of *Cissus* sp. Each arises
 on the stem opposite a leaf. This suggests that the plant originally had leaves in
 opposite pairs, and that one has been modified to form the tendril.

 To check this explanation, find a node at which no tendril has been
 formed.

- Does this node bear a pair of leaves, or a single leaf? 

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

This shows
 that our initial interpretation is wrong. The tendril cannot be a modified leaf.

 - Is the tendril in the correct position to have arisen from an axillary bud?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

 If it is neither a modified leaf nor a modified axillary branch, it
 must in fact be a modification of the tip of the main axis.

 In this species, each time a tendril is formed it uses up the apical
 meristem in the apical bud, so continued growth of the plant can only
 come from an axillary bud emerging from the axil between the last leaf
 and the tendril. As it grows, the axillary branch pushes the tendril
 to the side, and forms a continuation of the vertical axis of the
 plant. So the plant axis is formed by a new "side branch" at each node
 bearing a tendril. This pattern of growth is described as **sympodial
 growth**. Sympodial growth is also seen in some plants where the
 apical bud is used up to form a flower.


### Examine specimens D, E and F  

Determine in each case whether the climbing structure (tendril or claw) 
	represents an apical bud, and axillary bud, a leaf or part of a leaf. 
	Enter your answers in Table 1.2.

## Introduction To The Use Of An Identification Key

	**Plant identification is a key skill from this course. 
	 This skill is essential in a range of careers
	 including consultancy, bush regeneration, government and research**

Plant identification almost always is based on a key.  The aims of this exercise are to learn how to use an identification key, and also to become familiar with a range of common vegetative features of plants. Use the preceding section and the glossary to understand all the terms in the key.

A key is a device that progressively eliminates
possibilities until the identification is complete. At each step in the
process it asks you to choose which of a pair of contrasting conditions
or characters occurs in your specimen, and then directs you to the next
appropriate choice depending on the condition chosen. It is important to
realise that you do **not** have to use all the possible alternatives
for any one specimen. The contrasting alternatives can be arranged in
either of the following ways:

 1. In **Bracketed Keys** the contrasting alternatives are placed together, usually under a single number. Each alternative directs you to the numbered alternative that should be examined next. Hence, the first alternative under number 1 might direct you to 2 (the second pair of contrasting conditions), while the second alternative under 1 may direct you to 13, omitting all the intervening pairs (2 to 12).

2. In **Indented Keys** the contrasting alternatives are marked with the
 same symbols (numbers or letters) and indented or inset the same
 distance from the left hand margin, but are not necessarily placed
 directly under each other; indeed, they can sometimes be on different
 pages of the book, so one has to search for the alternative. Commonly
  the first and second alternatives are distinguished as A and \*A, B
 and \*B, etc. Having decided which alternative best fits the specimen,
 proceed to the pair of alternatives that immediately *follows* the
 correct alternative (**downwards!**). Hence, if your specimen fits the
 second of two alternatives, say \*B, ignore all the choices listed below
 B and go to the first choice listed under \*B.

In **both** types, it is essential to -

1. always proceed downwards;
2.  **read both alternatives carefully** **before** deciding which best fits the specimen, and check any unfamiliar terms in the glossary. **Never** decide that the first alternative is correct before you read the second of the contrasting pair!

 Now turn to the key at the back of the lab manual. This is a key that uses only
vegetative characters. The advantage of such a key is that it does not
 require you to have flowers or fruit, which are only on the tree in
 certain seasons. Use this key to identify at least two of the
 specimens.

# Week 3: Floral Morphology and Inflorescences

Reference: Raven, P.H., Evert, R.F. & Eichhorn, S.E. 2013. **The Biology
of Plants 8$^{th}$ edition** pp 478-492.

In this practical, we will examine the floral characters of typical
angiosperms. In addition, we will introduce you to sufficient
terminology that you can use identification keys based on reproductive
characters.

Adaptation of floral structure to a wide variety of pollination
mechanisms has produced a vast array of different flowers. Analysing
these differences is basic to identification of angiosperms. Since full
descriptions are difficult to write and tedious to read, and most of us
are not artistic enough to make accurate drawings of flowers, short-hand
methods of recording some of the important features have been developed.

###Background

Before the class, read the following section on recording floral
structure and examine the diagrams supplied in this manual.

Make sure you can distinguish between the following sets of terms
(consult the glossary at the back of the manual):

1. determinate and indeterminate growth

2. radial and bilateral symmetry

3. perianth, petal, corolla, sepal, calyx

4. ovary, ovule and ovum

5. carpel and gynoecium

##Floral structure

As you will see, flowers are complex, highly specialised, and exhibit
tremendous morphological diversity across taxa. Botanists have a number
of ways of describing floral structure.

**A floral formula** can express the number, fusion and insertion of
floral parts.

The symbols used are as follows:

- **K** : calyx (sepals)

- **C** : corolla (petals)

- **P** refers to the perianth, when calyx (**K**) and corolla (**C**) are not different.

- **A** : androecium i.e. the number and arrangement of stamens and staminodes.

- **G** : gynoecium i.e. the number and arrangement of carpels.

- **G** $_{\underline{4}}$ : a line under the number for G indicates a superior ovary

- **G** $_{\overline{3}}$ : a line over the number for G indicates an inferior ovary

- **\*** : radially symmetric flower ie. actinomorphic

- .|. : bilaterally symmetric flower ie. zygomorphic

- \(5) signifies fusion of parts in the same whorl;

- [C$_5$+A$_5$] or C$_5$+A$_5$ indicates fusion between the parts of different whorls.

For example, the floral formula:

\* K$_{5}$ [C$_{(5)}$ A$_{5+5}$] G$_{(\underline{3})}$
  
signifies a radially symmetrical flower with 5 free sepals, 5 fused
petals, 2 whorls each of 5 stamens that arise from the inside of the
petals, and 3 fused carpels with a superior ovary.

Cut a longitudinal section through a flower to determine whether the
ovary is superior or inferior. Cut a cross section through the basal
part of the flower through the ovary to determine the number and
arrangement of the carpels (locules). Then gently squeeze each section
of the ovary. If the ovules pop out of one end then you can assume that
they must be attached at the other end.

**A floral diagram** is a ground plan that can express number of
    parts, fusion and some of the symmetry, but not whether the ovary is
    superior or inferior. It helps to draw concentric circles for each
    whorl first in light pencil as a guide for the diagram. The position
    of the inflorescence axis and the subtending bract or leaf can also
    be shown. The figures and show examples of floral diagrams and
    floral formulae

![ A floral diagram of *Flindersia*, a rainforest tree of
 northern NSW. Note that each successive whorl is offset by the same
 angle. This alternation of whorls is a feature of virtually all
 flowers. There is an outer whorl of fertile stamens (the five lobed
 anthers between the petals) and an inner whorl of sterile staminodes
 (the five circles opposite the petals). Fusion is shown by joining
 parts with a line (as for the sepals). Note that the petals are shown
 to overlap, the stamens in the inner whorl are reduced and sterile,
 and the 5 locules show axile placentation. These points are not
 indicated in the formula.](floralDiagram.png)

of the Agavaceae. In *Agave*, the vascular traces to the whorls of

tissue.](ovary_position_evolution.png)

\newpage

##Inflorescences

Species in which the flowers arise singly in the axil of leaves on
ordinary vegetative branches are usually considered to have the
primitive flower arrangement. Mostly, specialised flowering branches
called inflorescences are produced. There is considerable variation in
the pattern in which flowers are borne on inflorescences. The more an
inflorescence differs from an ordinary vegetative branch, the more
highly evolved it is usually considered.

- The inflorescence on *specimen A* is said to be *anthotelic* (ending
 in a flower), because the growing apex of the inflorescence axis is used
 up to form a flower, and subsequent growth is from lateral branches. The
 pattern of branching and the length of the internodes within the
 inflorescence are used to define sub-types (see figures). Which sub-type
 of the anthotelic inflorescence is this?

- *Specimen B* has a *blastotelic* inflorescence (ending in a branch
 or vegetative bud). The apical bud of the inflorescence axis is not used
 to form a flower, and so the inflorescence is potentially indeterminate:
 ie. it could continue to grow indefinitely. Hence these inflorescences
 often do not have such a precisely defined size as anthotelic ones. When
 the axis of the inflorescence reverts back to vegetative growth at the
 end of the flowering season, the inflorescence becomes *intercalary*
 rather than *terminal* on the plant (ie. within a branch, rather than on
 the end of a branch). Which of the sub-types of the blastotelic
 inflorescence is this (see figures)?

- A mixture of branching patterns may occur within the one
 inflorescence. These are described in order of branching eg. a raceme of
 cymes - the cyme is the terminal form (see figures). Describe the
 inflorescence in specimens *C,* *D* and *E*. Record each in the form of
 a line diagram, as in Fig 3.9. Note carefully whether the flowers are
 sessile or have a peduncle.

![Types of inflorescences. The sequence in which the flowers
open is indicated by size of the circles representing the flowers;
largest opens first, smallest opens last.](inflorescenceTypes.png)

##Plant Identification

### Examine the floral structure of the specimen provided.

 **Perianth.** 
 
 - How many whorls of perianth are present? If there is
 more than one whorl, do they alternate in position as in Fig 3.1? Are
 they differentiated into calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals)?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

 - How many parts are present in each whorl?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

 - Are the petals free from the base or are they fused into a tube? Do
 they arise from the base of the ovary or from above the ovary? Is the ovary
 **superior** or **inferior** (see figures)? Would you describe the
 flower as hypogynous, epigynous or perigynous?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

 **Androecium.** 
 
 - Does the number of stamens relate readily to the
 number in each perianth whorl, or is it very large and variable from
 flower to flower? Can you determine a constant number of stamens for the
 flower?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

 - Do the stamens arise from a rim-like extension of the receptacle at
 the top of the ovary by individual stalks, from the top of a staminal
 tube formed by fusion of the stalks (see figures), or from some distance
 up on the inner surface of the petals? The stamens may appear to be
 all on the one whorl, but often we can distinguish inner and outer
 whorls by their position in relation to the petals (see Figures).

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

 **Symmetry.** Study the symmetry of the flower from above. 
 
 - Is there more than one axis of symmetry? Are the parts of each whorl all of the
 same size? What type of symmetry is shown: **radial** or **bilateral**?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

 **Gynoecium.** Note the single style arising in the centre of the
 flower. The structure of the ovary is often seen more clearly in
 developing fruits. Cut the ovary transversely with a razor blade and
 examine the cut surface with a hand lens. Make certain you have cut
 through the centre of the ovary, and not above or below it. You should
 be able to see several ovule-containing regions (**locules**) separated
 by thin radial walls. The ovules will appear to radiate from the
 **placenta**. Otherwise, if you gently squeeze the ovary, the ovules
 will pop up from the surface, but some will remain attached to the
 placenta. Is the placenta on the outer wall or at the centre of the
 ovary? How many locules and placentas are there? Use this information to
 determine the number of carpels in the gynoecium.

 - Is the flower **apocarpous** or **syncarpous** (see figures)? Which
 term in that figure describes the placentation?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}


 Now determine the position of the locules in relation to the other
 parts in the flower. Does the centre of each locule lie opposite a sepal or in
 between two sepals (ie., opposite a petal)? Note the pattern of
 alternating whorls of floral parts (sepals, petals, stamens and
 carpels).

 **Floral diagram.** Draw enough concentric circles for the whorls of
 perianth and stamens, making the diameter of the inner one at least 4 cm
 so as to leave plenty of room in the centre to draw in the gynoecium
 later. Draw in the perianth on the outer whorls, following the most
 appropriate example in the flower figure.

 Draw in the stamens as lobed anthers (to distinguish them from sterile **staminodes**; see figures), making certain to position each stamen
 correctly with respect to the perianth members. If the stamens are
 fused with the perianth, join the anther to the appropriate perianth
 part (inner or outer) by a straight line (see figures).

 Draw the gynoecium in the centre of your floral diagram. Use **two
 lines,** one for the outer wall of the ovary and another for the walls that divide the
 locules. Show some ovules attached to the placenta in each locule of
 the ovary (see figures).

- Cut a second flower of the specimen vertically along a diameter that
    divides the flower symmetrically. Note how the ovary is positioned
    in the flower with respect to the receptacle and point of attachment
    of the stamens, etc. Would you describe the flower as
    **hypogynous**, **perigynous** or **epigynous** (see figures)?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- Now summarize the floral structure in a floral formula.

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

## Plant Identification

### Introduction to the use of the ‘Key to Plant Families’

 Use “The key to some Australian Plant families” found at the end of
 the lab manual to identify the specimen supplied to family level.

 First, examine the flower and construct a floral formula for it. Check
 this with a demonstrator, so that you are sure you have interpreted
 the flower correctly, **before proceeding to the key.**

 It is essential to read **both** alternatives carefully before
 deciding which one fits the specimen. Check every unfamiliar term in
 the *Glossary* at the back of this book. At each stage, one
 alternative must fit the specimen. If neither is correct, you must
 have made a mistake in an earlier choice, so check each preceding
 choice.

 Always proceed **downwards** in the key. Chose the correct alternative
 of a pair and then go to the **next pair below the correct one**.
 Proceed until the chosen alternative is linked to the name of a
 family.

 When you have a family name for the specimen, check with a
 demonstrator

 If time permits, identify one of the other specimens provided.

 You should practice using this key whenever you have an opportunity.
 It is a valuable botanical skill and **the use of such keys *will* be
 tested in this course**.

### Plant Identification and Family Descriptions

We will examine the key traits and features of some of the **major

#Week 4: Plant Cells

You should refer to the notes on Light Microscopy and the use of the
Olympus CHA Microscope which you will find in the manual introduction.

Only a few types of cell are found in higher plants. These can be
recognised on several basic features:

- shape

- wall thickness

- wall composition

- whether empty or full of cytoplasm

- presence or absence of specific organelles such as chloroplasts.

Once you are familiar with the diagnostic features of various cell
types, you can recognise these in any unknown section and use the
information to work out complex tissue arrangements in leaves, stems or
roots.

The practical skills you should aim to perfect in this lab are:

1. recognition of the major cell types in supporting and ground tissue;

2. section cutting by hand with a razor blade;

3. drawing.

**Note:** see the introductory notes in the front of this manual.

This practical deals *only* with the cell types found in "ground" and
supporting tissue. Cells modified for transport are dealt with later.

##Parenchyma and Collenchyma

Celery is a leaf petiole. Strip off one of the celery "strings" - these
are strands of collenchyma tissue. Do not confuse collenchyma with the
vascular bundles. Note how elastic the strings are.

Cut several thin transverse sections of the petiole. Stain your thinnest
sections with toluidine blue. You should stain them until the whole
section becomes a deep purple with blue areas in the vascular bundles.
The collenchyma walls now stain purple. Are these walls lignified? What
colour do lignified walls stain?

Make a high power drawing of three collenchyma cells showing the
position of wall thickenings and middle lamella. How is a plant cell
wall deposited?

Cut an L.S. and stain with toluidine blue and examine. Locate the ends
of the cells. Make a sketch to illustrate the shape in 3-D of a
collenchyma cell. How much longer are they than wide?

Compare the parenchyma cells in the ground tissue with the collenchyma
with respect to the following:

a. overall cell diameter

b. diameter of cell lumen

c. colour of wall staining with toluidine blue

d. cell length

e. wall thickness

f. appearance of intercellular space

Make a high power drawing of **3 parenchyma** cells for comparison with
the collenchyma to illustrate the differences.

##Aerenchyma and Chlorenchyma

These are two common types of specialised parenchyma.

Cut sections of the *Juncus* cladode. Rinse for 10 minutes, then stain
with toluidine blue and examine

The pith of the cladode is filled with *aerenchyma* while the cortex is
*chlorenchyma*.

- What is the characteristic of chlorenchyma?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}




- What are the diagnostic features of aerenchyma, with respect to wall
thickness and staining, cell contents and cell shape?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}





Draw a few cells in an accurate, high power diagram and hand in for
assessment.

\vspace*{6\baselineskip}






Why should plants have aerenchyma?

\vspace*{6\baselineskip}




<!---
 ***FEEDBACK***: **You will likely be assessed on biological drawing
 from microscope sections in the practical exam. Hand in your drawing
 of the *Juncus* cladode and we will provide feedback. A submission of
 this drawing will count towards your participation mark.**
-->

The classic example of tissue that is both chlorenchyma and aerenchyma
is the spongy mesophyll of many leaves.

## Sclerenchyma

### Sclereids

 Taste the apple and pear and compare the texture of the two fruits.
 Cut thin sections through the pulp of each fruit. Rinse for 10 minutes,
 then stain with toluidine blue for 5 minutes, rinse again. Mount in
 glycerine and examine. You may have to squash the pear tissue. (When
 squashing a section on a slide, wrap the slide in a tissue and press
 gently but firmly with your thumb - taking care to avoid twisting - and
 not breaking the cover-slip.)

- Can you explain the difference in texture in cellular terms?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}





Draw a small (no more than 5) group of sclereids accurately.

\vspace*{10\baselineskip}





Again determine wall thickness, chemical composition of the wall and
whether the contents are living or not. Locate the pits by careful
focusing using high power.

- Do both fruits have sclereids? What might be the possible functional
significance of such cells in a fruit?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}





- Cut a section of the *Hakea* leaf provided. Where are the sclereids? What is their staining reaction with toluidine blue and what inference can you draw about wall composition? What do you need to do in order to confirm that these are indeed sclereids and not fibres?

\vspace*{6\baselineskip}





### Fibres

 Examine the leaves of *Lomandra longifolia* Notice how hard and
 stiff they are. Hard leaves contain large numbers of fibres and are
 often termed sclerophylls. Cut free hand sections across the leaf with a
 razor blade to determine the distribution of fibres. Stain with toluidine blue, rinse, mount in glycerine and examine.

The fibres occur in groups on either side of the vascular bundles to
form leaf ridges. The lignin in their walls stains bright blue with
toluidine blue. Determine wall thickness, composition, nature of
contents etc. and draw if you have time.

 Now cut sections at right angles to your previous ones, ie.
 paradermal, to obtain an LS through a fibre bundle and stain as above.
 What is the relationship between the length and width of these fibres?
 Which of those cell types you have studied today are the fibres most
 like and in what important ways do they differ from these?

\vspace*{6\baselineskip}





## Plant Cells: Supplementary Notes

Various different types of cells are found in the mature plant body.
Each performs a specific function. In the practical classes you will be
looking at a range of different plant tissues and you will be expected
to be able to identify the major cell types. The notes given below
should help to clarify the important features of each type.

### Parenchyma

In herbaceous plants 80% of the plant body is composed of parenchyma.
The term parenchyma is used for tissues composed of *living* cells
generally having *thin wholly primary walls* and a *polyhedral shape*
(generally but not always isodiametric) (See Fiures). [A wall is said
to be wholly primary if the thickening of the wall is completed before
the cell has reached its full size, any thickening laid down after the
cell has reached its full size is said to be secondary.] Parenchyma is
the main representative of the ground tissue system: this forms a
continuous tissue in all major plant organs, e.g., cortex of roots, pith
and cortex of stems, ground tissue of petioles and mesophyll of leaves.
Parenchyma cells also occur as components of complex tissue systems
(such as xylem and phloem) either scattered singly or aggregated.
Generally parenchyma is unlignified but lignified parenchyma can occur,
particularly as a component of xylem. A number of types of parenchyma
can be recognised including:

- **chlorenchyma**: parenchyma containing chloroplasts, found in leaves,
 outsides of stems and rarely in certain specialized roots;

-  **storage parenchyma**: contains stored food reserves, most commonly
 starch grains but other reserves also occur such as sucrose, inulin
 etc.; may be found throughout the plant or concentrated in special
 storage organs such as tubers, rhizomes, storage roots etc.;

- **aerenchyma**: parenchyma in which the cells have extended processes
 so increasing the amount of intercellular air space in the tissue.
 Found in some leaves, e.g., *Ananas* (pineapple), *Canna*, some stems,
 e.g., *Juncus*, and the roots of many plants from waterlogged
 habitats.

### Collenchyma

Collenchyma is a living tissue composed of more or less elongated cells
with thick, non-lignified primary walls (see Figures). It is the main
supporting tissue in the leaves and stems of many dicotyledons, for
example in the midrib and petiole of leaves and in strands in the outer
cortex of stems (often forming ridges). Collenchyma is well adapted to
function as support tissue in growing organs, as it combines high
tensile strength with considerable plasticity. Unlike sclerenchyma it is
extensible. The cell walls are made of cellulose, hemicellulose and
pectin and normally stain a very bright pink with toluidine blue and are
considered to be primary. *The wall material is deposited unevenly and
is particularly thick at cell corners* - a good diagnostic feature in
TS.

With age, the cells of collenchyma may, in some species become lignified
and therefore the tissue changes into sclerenchyma.

### Sclerenchyma

Sclerenchyma refers to a tissue composed of cells with thick, rigid,
secondary walls (usually but not always lignified) whose function is
support and/or protection; frequently the cells lack protoplasts at
maturity. Many different cell types are involved but two major groups
are recognized: fibres and sclereids.

### Fibres
 
Fibres are long tapered interlocking cells, normally unbranched.
Typically without protoplasts at maturity and with obscure simple
pitting; frequently, but not always, lignified (unlignified fibres are
most often associated with phloem). Fibres may occur singly or in groups
and are often associated with vascular tissue (see Figures).

Fibres produced by plants have been used commercially for centuries. At
present, plants from 44 different families are used as sources of fibre.
Common commercial fibres may be divided into textile fibres including
flax (*Linum usitatissimum*) jute (*Corchorus* spp.), hemp (*Cannabis
sativa* - yes it does have a legitimate use!) and ramie (*Boehmeria
nivea*), and cordage fibres, including sisal (*Agave sisalana*),
bowstring hemp (*Sansevieria* spp.) and New Zealand flax (*Phormium
tenax*). Extraction of most fibres is by a process called "retting".
This decomposes the middle lamellae between cells so that they separate.
The plant material is left in water while decomposition occurs, then
dried and passed between rollers which separates the fibres from the
outer tissue.

Bast is the name given to the fibres associated with phloem in various
smooth barked trees, most notably the lime (*Tilia* spp.). This was
formerly stripped from trees to make a coarse fabric.

###**Sclereids** 

These vary greatly in shape. They differ from fibres in
that they do not have a very elongated simple shape. Usually they have
very thick secondary walls with obvious pits and are strongly lignified
(see Figures). Often classified on the basis of shape, but according to
Esau (1977), this is of limited use because the various forms
intergrade. These cells, individually or in groups are widely
distributed in the plant body, but are particularly common in leaves,
fruits and seeds.

### Xylam vessels and tracheids

Xylem is a complex tissue, composed of conducting (or tracheary)
elements, fibres and parenchyma.

Conducting elements are of two kinds, **tracheids** and **vessel
members**. Both are elongated cells, thick walled and without living
contents at maturity. The secondary wall is laid down in various
patterns and usually becomes lignified.

- **Tracheids** originate from single cells, are normally elongated and
pointed at both ends and are imperforate, i.e., pit closing membranes
being present in the region of pits. Tracheids are present in all
divisions of vascular plants (and were present in all fossil groups of
vascular plant as well) and are the only tracheary elements in
pteridophytes and gymnosperms.

- **Vessels** consist of chains of cells in a longitudinal file. They are
present in the wood of nearly all angiosperms. In each file of cells the
transverse end walls are perforated so that the lumens of adjacent cells
are in continuity. Each 'cell' is known as a **vessel member**. Although
vessel members are very short, vessels may be several centimetres long
in some species. Xylem elements which differentiate during early phases of growth,
usually have a thin primary wall with rings or helices of secondary wall
thickening deposited on it. These 'annular'  or 'helical'
 xylem elements (see figures) are extensible and often become very
much stretched during the elongation of the organ in which they occur so
that the thickenings become more widely spaced. Later formed elements
have more extensive regions of secondary wall thickening and are not
extensible. These are 'reticulate'  or
'pitted' elements (see figures).

- *Phloem*: sieve tubes and companion cells. Phloem is a complex tissue comprising sieve tubes, companion cells, parenchyma, fibres and sclereids. The transporting elements are called the sieve elements. These are of two kinds, **sieve cells** (which occur in pteridophytes and gymnosperms) and **sieve tubes** which occur in
angiosperms.

- **Sieve cells** are elongated cells with special sieve areas in lateral
and occasionally terminal walls.

- **Sieve tubes** are longitudinal files of cells, each of which is called
a **sieve tube member**. In these cells the sieve areas in the
transverse walls are specialised and form a **sieve plate** (see Figure). This is a porous region of the wall through which the protoplasts
of adjacent sieve tube members interconnect. Mature sieve elements have living contents (protoplasts) although they
usually lack normal nucleus. They are usually closely associated with
**companion cells** (see Figure). (These both originate by division of
the same cell.) Companion cells are elongated cells with living contents
including large nuclei and dense cytoplasm. From one to several
companion cells are associated with each sieve element and it is thought
that there is a close functional relationship between them, but the
precise function of companion cells is controversial.

See Raven Ch 23 for more information on plant cells.

# Week 5: Leaves and water loss

Reference: The Biology of Plants  pp 592-604.

Although leaves are all constructed to a basic plan, they vary greatly
in physiognomy, morphology and internal arrangement of tissues. Syndromes of modifications
are often correlated with particular environments and are therefore
interpreted as being of adaptive significance.

In this practical we will look at leaves from plants from different
environments and representing different leaf forms and life histories.

Each digital file (save for one) in today’s prac is of transverse leaf sections.

## ADD OVERVIEW FOR THIS PRAC HERE


## The evolution of specialisation in leaf tissue

We have specimens of *Psilotum* (a seedless vascular plant), *Pinus* (a
conifer), and many flowering plants (e.g. *Hibbertia scandens*). Open
each of these three images.

*Psilotum* and *Pinus* represent an evolutionary jump in the
specialisation of photosynthetic tissue (from a green photosynthesising
stem to a specialised needle leaf).

- Is there any evidence that *Pinus* leaves are more specialised for
photosynthesis than *Psilotum* stems?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- Photosynthetic stems are required to support the plant as well as
photosynthesise. Are support cells present in *Psilotum* stems that are
not seen in *Pinus* stems? If so, why is the presence of these support
cells problematic for photosynthesis?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- Do *Pinus* leaves have more specialised cell types than *Psilotum*
stems?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

Compare the *Pinus* leaf to the angiosperm *Hibbertia scandens* leaf.

- Are the parenchyma cells arranged differently in the two leaf types?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- Are there more specialised cell types or arrangements in angiosperm
leaves? 

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

##  Adaptations to arid environments

Leaves are a primary source of water loss in plants. Many Australian
plants have to deal with regular droughts or consistently arid
environments. As a consequence, these plants express many adaptations
limit water loss. Open the images for each of the plants in the table
below and list the adaptations to limit water loss.

# Week 6: Root Structure & Function

Reference: Raven Biology of Plants. ch 24.

## Introduction

Plants invest significant carbon captured in
photosynthesis into their root systems. Roots have four functions:

1. Resources uptake

2. Anchorage

3. Transport

4. Storage

The last three of these functions are always done by the plant itself.  The first one, resource uptake is often done via symbiotic partners.

Although the branching patterns and size of
roots vary greatly with different species and in different conditions,
the morphology and anatomy of all root systems is fundamentally similar.

The basic structure of all roots is similar to that of a primary root
covered in the first year course. We will assume
that you have remembered this knowledge. Otherwise the reference above
will help.

Since all roots have an essentially similar plan we will focus mostly on
root specialisations which enhance root survival and nutrient
acquisition.

First we will examine how lateral branches are produced. They are
ENDOGENOUS - that is, in contrast to stems, they are initiated deep
inside root tissues.

## Root morphology

### The initiation of lateral roots

Lateral roots are initiated early in development in broad beans (*Vicia
faba*). Cut transverse sections of root tissue through a young emerging
lateral root and down the root where no lateral root has yet emerged and
stain with toluidine blue.

- From which tissues are lateral roots initiated?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}



- Think about the vascular connections in roots.  Where is the xylem in a root compared to in a stem? 

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}




### When is a root not a root?

<!---
Can we get a rhizome to look at?
-->

 Aerating roots are an example of specialised roots with an atypical resource uptake function. 
 
 Here we will examine
 the pneumatophores - aerating roots that emerge from the dense, anoxic mud in mangrove
 swamps.

 Use the following questions to conduct an investigative exercise into
 the differences between mangrove pneumatophores and a typical primary
 root.

- Is there an obvious root cap?



\vspace*{3\baselineskip}


-  What strange thing does the root tip do when it emerges from the mud?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}



-  What is the primary function of a pneumatophore? What adaptations do
    pneumatophores have that allow them to carry out this function?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}



## Strategies for enhancing Plant Nutrition

###Root nodules: symbiotic fixation of Atmospheric nitrogen

 Cut and stain sections of the legume root nodules and also examine the
 demonstration sections. Determine, and make drawings to illustrate,
 the nature and distribution of the micro-organisms involved.

 In what ways does infection alter the morphology of the infected root?
 (You will need to compare infected and non-infected roots in each
 case.)

### Proteoid or “Cluster” roots 

 Examine the proteoid roots and determine their morphology. 
 

### Mycorrhizas

There are two types of mycorrhizal associates: ectomycorrhizal fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.  Both principally trade the plant P for sugars.  Ectomycorrhizal fungi also can trade N to the plant for sugar.  The fungi involved are called ectomycorrhizal fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.  One plant and fungus symbiosis together is called a mycorrhyza (plural: mycorrhizas).

Arbuscular mycorrhizas are found in almost all vascular plants.  They create a structure **inside** a cortical cell to exchange materiel with the plant; these tiny tree-like structures are called arbuscules.

Ectomycorrhizas found in specific families across the plant tree of life, including Myrataceae and Fabaceae.  They create a net-like hyphal structure **outside** the plant root where exchange occurs.

Some species, including Eucalyptus spp., have both types of mycorrhizas.  Examine the fixed material of the *Eucalyptus* roots and identify
    the characteristic appearance of ectomycorrhizal root systems

#Week 7:  Stem Structure and Secondary Thickening

## Vascular Tissue

References : Raven et al. (2013) ch 25-26

The cells involved in long distance transport invariably occur together
in the same region of a stem or root. There are two systems: xylem,
involved in water transport and phloem, in sugar (usually sucrose)
transport. Collectively these are known as vascular tissue.

In stems xylem and phloem occur together in vascular bundles, which are
distributed either in a ring (dicotyledons) or scattered throughout
(monocotyledons). In contrast in roots, they occur in the centre as a
stele. The system is continuous throughout the plant and extends into
the leaves as the major and minor veins.

The purpose of today's lab is to demonstrate the features of the types
of cells that are found in xylem and phloem, so that these may be
considered in relation to their role in transport.

### Vascular Cells And Tissue

*Xylem tissue comprise the following:* 

1. vessels (transporting cells, only in angiosperms)

2. tracheids (transporting cells, all vascular plants)

3. parenchyma

4. fibres

*Phloem contains:*

1. sieve tubes (transporting cells)

2. sieve cells (transporting cells)

3. companion cells

4. parenchyma

5. fibres

The dye toluidine blue is very useful in differentiating between xylem
and phloem. Vessels, tracheids, fibres and sometimes also the xylem
parenchyma contain lignin in their walls, which will therefore stain
bright blue or green. In contrast, the only cells in the phloem that are
lignified are the fibres. Walls of sieve tubes, sieve cells and
companion cells, which are not lignified usually stain a bright purple.

Apart from this, there are also important structural differences that
distinguish the transporting cells in these two tissue types and the
purpose of this lab is to investigate these.

## Xylem: tracheids and vessel elements 

The transporting cells of the xylem are modified into either vessel
elements or tracheids. In addition, xylem contains fibres and xylem
parenchyma (which may or may not be lignified). The basic distinction
between tracheids and vessel elements is that the tracheid is an
imperforate cell while the end walls of vessel elements are perforated.

### Vessel elements

 **Petiole of *Apium graveolens***

 Cut both longitudinal and transverse sections (T.S.) of celery
 petiole, stain with toluidine blue and mount in 50% glycerol. Make
 sure the sections pass through vascular bundles.

 Using the longitudinal sections (L.S.) examine and draw the different
 kinds of xylem vessels you see, paying particular attention to the
 pattern of lignin deposition and the structure of the end walls.

 List features of xylem vessels as seen in T.S. (i.e. size, thickness
 of wall etc.).

 How do vessels differ from 
 
1. fibres?

2. collenchyma?

3. tracheids? when seen in T.S.

 ### L.S. and T.S. of stem of *Cucurbita* sp.

 Examine xylem tissue in prepared slides of R.L.S. (G11/2) and T.S.
 (G11/1) sections of *Cucurbita* stem.

 Determine the kinds of wall thickening present in xylem vessels. Draw
 perforated end walls (the slides are variable in quality).

 Fresh material is also available for hand cut sections.

###  Tracheids

 Tracheids are the only xylem element found in conifer woods. These are
 elongated, tapered, thick-walled cells.

 Examine the prepared slide of R.L.S. *Pinus* stem.

 If you focus carefully along individual tracheids you will find that
 many of them

 have tapered ends which overlap with the ends of adjacent tracheids.
 The pits in these tracheids are highly specialised and called bordered
 pits. Examine micrographs of these in the demonstration. What might be
 their purpose?

### **PHLOEM**: sieve tubes and companion cells

 *Phloem tissue in *Cucurbita* sp.*

 Vascular tissue in *Cucurbita* spp. is ideal for studying phloem
 because the sieve tubes are very large and the sieve plates are
 obvious.

 Cut T.S. and L.S. of *Cucurbita* stem by hand, stain with toluidine
 blue. Find sieve tubes and companion cells.

 *Phloem tissue* : Examine the demonstration photomicrographs of the
development of sieve tubes and companion cells on the side bench.

## Secondary Thickening 

The primary growth of the stem is laid down by the **procambium**. In
dicots the vascular tissue is arranged in a cylinder near the periphery
of the stem, with the primary xylem inside the primary phloem. Secondary
growth results from activity of the **vascular cambium,** a lateral
meristem that is derived from the procambial layer between the primary
xylem and phloem. This layer is meristematic, i.e. it retains the
capacity to divide. Derivatives of the vascular cambium give rise to
**secondary xylem** internally and **secondary phloem** externally. Both
these secondary tissues include **rays** that facilitate radial
transport and which are also formed by divisions of the vascular
cambium.

###  Secondary growth in herbaceous plants

Many herbaceous plants have a limited amount of secondary growth in the
older and slightly woody parts of the plant. A study of *Coleus* will
help you to revise primary stem structure in the dicot, and illustrate
the early stages of vascular cambial activity.

  Cut thin transverse sections through an internode in *Coleus* from
    about the middle of plant. Stain with toluidine blue and mount in
    glycerine. Note the following features in the section:

1.  Epidermis and cortex (indicate types of cells present).
    - The wider parts of the vascular cylinder which contain the original
 primary vascular bundles, (primary phloem and primary xylem).
    - A continuous ring of vascular cambium (small block-shaped
 thin-walled cells) that can be divided into those parts formed from procambium within the
 primary vascular bundles (the **fascicular cambium**) and those parts
 extending between the bundles and which were formed by
 de-differentiation of parenchyma (**interfascicular cambium**).

2. Is any periderm is forming in the cortex?

  \vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- The location of protoxylem with respect to the metaxylem. Is the
 development of the primary xylem **endarch** or **exarch** in this stem?

  \vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- Examine the fascicular cambium (within a bundle). In *Coleus* and
 most herbaceous dicots the fascicular cambium gives rise to some
 secondary xylem and secondary phloem, even when externally there is no
 obvious thickening of the stem. Distinguish the boundary between the
 primary and secondary xylem. Note the scattered large empty vessel
 elements in the secondary xylem. What other cell types are present?

  \vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- Now examine the interfascicular cambium (between the bundles). In
 many species this produces similar secondary xylem. In *Coleus*,
 however, the interfascicular cambium produces a regular tissue devoid of
 vessels. Are the walls of these cells lignified? Do the cells contain a
 protoplast? What sort of cell do you think is forming the
 interfascicular regions of the secondary xylem? What do you think this
 region of the secondary xylem contributes to the stem in a functional
 sense?

  \vspace*{3\baselineskip}

Draw a high power drawing of 2-3 cells from the interfascicular
    region of the vascular cambium, together with 2 cells on either side
    of each cambial initial (ie., a strip 2-3 cells wide and 5 cells
    deep)

  \vspace*{6\baselineskip}

### Secondary growth in woody plants

Activity of the cambium enables long life, by renewal of vascular
tissue, as well as increase in size of the plant, by strengthening the
stem. Secondary growth, both of vascular tissue and of periderm (cork),
may be relatively continuous or seasonal.

*Morphology*

 Examine the leaf-bearing branch of the Camphor Laurel (*Cinnamomum
 camphora* ) and note the obvious increase in thickness of stem with
 age. Note that this species develops winter-buds protected by bud
 scales (modified leaves that never expand or become photosynthetic).
 The buds expand to form a new section of stem bearing photosynthetic
 leaves each spring, the bud scales falling away to leave a cluster of
 scars. Hence the past positions of the winter buds can be determined
 by looking for these clusters of scars, and the length of stem between
 the groups of scars corresponds to one year’s growth. It is therefore
 possible to date any part of the stem by counting the number of
 winter-bud positions between that point and the apical bud.

 Note that there is still no sign of bark development even on the
 thicker part of this branch. The outer surface is still the smooth
 epidermis with green cortex beneath.

By what factor has the diameter of the stem increased over the initial
primary (first year) stem at its thickest point? By what factor must the
epidermis have expanded?

  \vspace*{3\baselineskip}

 What processes must have accommodated this increase?

  \vspace*{3\baselineskip}

## Activity of the Vascular Cambium

*Young stem of a woody plant*

 You are provided with a transverse section (G35/1) of a first year
 stem of *Cinnamomum camphora*. There is already an active vascular
 cambium that has laid down a small amount of secondary xylem (although
 no secondary phloem is yet apparent). The cambium is thin-walled and
 tends to have been crushed during sectioning. Note the areas of more
 irregular primary xylem surrounding the pith. What are the obvious
 differences between this stem and the herbaceous stem of *Coleus*
 (above) and *Helianthus* (recall your first year work on Sunflower)?

 Draw and label a low power diagram to indicate the distribution of
 tissues in the stem.

 Note particularly the following primary tissues or regions:

 pith - what types of cells are present?

  \vspace*{3\baselineskip}

 pericyclic fibres - groups of thick-walled fibres outside the phloem -
 about how many cells separate adjacent fibre bundles?
 
 \vspace*{3\baselineskip}

 cortex - what type(s) of cells are present

 epidermis - closely fitting epidermal cells with dome–shaped outer
 walls, carrying a well developed cuticle.

# Week 8: Plant Allometry

Most aspects of plant function are size-dependent. In other words, the
function of plant traits varies in an exponential fashion with plant (or
organ) size. These size-dependent (or allometric) relationships are
central to understanding the nature of plant adaptations and constraints. In today’s lab, we will examine some important allometric relationships across plant vegetative and reproductive traits.

In order to examine allometric relationships, data must be collected
from plants across a range of sizes. Each group will be responsible for
collecting data, but we will need data from the entire class.

##  Adaptive responses to the presence of competitors in *Impatiens wallerana*.

The capacity to respond to competitors is a key adaptation for most
plants (plants rarely grow alone). One common adaptation is the
shade-avoidance response. The shade-avoidance response is induced by the
early detection of competitors. Plants can detect competitors by a
number of mechanisms. For example, green light reflected from the leaves
of competitors is low quality light received by phytochrome receptors in
the chloroplasts. In order to avoid being overtopped by competitors, a
plant will undergo a phenotypic shift to maximise height extension – the
shade-avoidance response.

We been growing *Impatiens wallerana* since early in the session under
two treatments – high density, and individually. High density plants
have been grown with a number of competitors. Record the following data
from the 1-2 randomly high density plants growing in the centre of the
pot (i.e. surrounded by competing plants) and the plants growing
individually in pots:

i)  The diameter of the main stem at ground level (in cm).

ii) The height of the main stem (in cm).

iii) Height / diameter

iv) Total leaf weight (remove all leaves, place in a paper bag, record
    mass).

Using class data – complete the graph and questions on the following
sheet. Check your answers with demonstrators / lecturers

![](graph.png)


- What are the average Height / Diameter values for each treatment
(high and low density)? What do these values tell us about how stem
architecture adaptively responds to environmental variability?

\vspace*{5\baselineskip}

 On the graph above, plot leaf mass vs stem diameter for all plants.
Use different symbols to plot plants from the high and low density
treatments. Fit a line of best fit (linear or non-linear) through all
data. 

- Is the relationship between leaf mass and stem diameter
allometric? 

\vspace*{5\baselineskip}

- What is the most likely mechanism behind the above
relationship? 

\vspace*{5\baselineskip}

- Based on these results, are there potential costs
associated with adaptive stem architecture (as seen in question 1)?

## Size-dependent reproduction in *Capsella bursa-pastoris*.

Reproductive effort (i.e. proportional allocation to reproduction) is a
major life history trait in plants and animals. In many plant
populations, reproductive effort increases with increasing plant size –
large plants have a higher relative allocation to reproduction than
small plants. We will test for size-dependent reproduction in *Capsella
bursa-pastoris* (shepherd’s purse).

For the individuals of *Capsella bursa-pastoris* provided, a) count the
total number of fruits (including the pedicels and/or dehisced tissue of
fruits that have already matured, and b) put the plant in a paper bag
and record its mass (remember to get the weight of the bag prior to
weighing the plant).

Calculate reproductive effort:

RE = Total number of fruits / Total plant mass.

Using the class data at the front of the lab, calculate the relationship
between RE and plant size.

- Is there an allometric relationship between reproductive effort and
plant size?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- How should large plants differ from small plants in their relative
contribution of seeds into the next generation? How should natural
selection act on plant sizes in populations where reproductive effort is
size-dependent?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

##  Seed size and dispersal in *Sonchus* sp.

The capacity to disperse offspring into new areas is an important trait
related to fitness and success in plants. Many plant species (like many
*Sonchus*, and many other daisies) employ a pappus (fine hairs on the
fruit or seed) as a parachute. Wind can keep these seeds aloft, allowing
them to travel great distances.

The capacity for a pappus to keep a seed aloft should be strongly
related to seed mass. This sets up an interesting evolutionary tradeoff–-plants that provision their offspring with a large endosperm (large seeds) are more likely to germinate and survive. Plants with small seeds
are more likely to successfully disperse into new habitats. Of course,
tradeoffs can be quite complex – selection on seed size should be very
strong if there is a allometric relationship between how fast a seed
falls to the ground and its mass. In other words, if large seeds fall to
earth disproportionately fast, then plants employing a wind dispersal
strategy will have strong limits on the size of seeds they can produce.

Here, we will examine the relationship between seed size and dispersal
ability using manipulated *Sonchus* seeds. These seeds are very small
(too small to individually weigh on our balances), so I divided them
into three treatment groups and recorded their average mass.

1.  Control seeds are simply seeds collected from their natural habitat
    (my neighbour’s garden) – average seed mass for these seeds is
    0.0003 g

2. Large seeds are seeds experimentally coated with a layer of glue –
    average seed mass for these seeds is 0.00045 g. Please note, I don’t
    have many of these seeds (treating them was very difficult), so
    don’t loose them.

3. Small seeds are seeds with the bottom portion removed – average
    seed mass for these seeds is 0.00025 g.

Tubes have been constructed in the back of the lab. The tubes can be
used to measure the rate seeds differing in mass fall without being
influenced by ambient air currents – they are 1m tall. Drop seeds of
each mass into the tube and record how fast they fall. Convert this to a
value for rate of descent (m/sec). Record your data in the table and
graph at the front of the lab.

- Is there an allometric (non-linear) relationship between seed mass and
how fast seeds fall?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- What does this say about the seed size evolution in wind dispersed
species? Should seed size limitations control the types of habitats in
which wind dispersed species will be found?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

##  Allometry and fruit size.

Most of the fruits and vegetables we eat are the product of thousands of
generations of artificial selection on traits that are beneficial to us.
For example, the ancestors to most of our fruits are relatively small.
We modified these fruits by using natural variation in fruit traits,
(and, in some cases, fruit trait) mutants to maximise the size and
nutritional quality of our fruits. Any selection (natural or artificial)
acts on variation within populations – traits that limit the fitness of
a genotype will be quickly removed from a population by processes of
natural selection.

Since fruit size is a variable trait within populations, we can predict
that increasing fruit size does not come at a fitness cost to plants. We
will test this prediction using variants of capsicum (*Capsicum annum*).

From each of the capsicum variants, separate the seeds from the non seed
fruit tissue. Put this material in paper bags and weigh the seed and non
seed components. Record the mass of each component on the table and
graph at the front of the lab.

- Is there any evidence of allometric relationships between seed mass and
non-seed fruit mass across individuals of capsicum?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- What would allometric relationships indicate about our capacity to
develop fruits for agriculture?

#Week 9: Flowering Plant Diversity

In this lab, we will be examining the history of plant diversity.  *Phylogenetics* is the study of diversity through time.  In this lab we will do a practical introduction to the basics of phylogenetics and how it relates to what we've been studying this term.  

First some history: seed plants are about 375 Million years old (Silvestro et al. 2015).  The age of angiosperms is a subject of much recent debate but probably the most recent common ancestor of all angiosperms lived between 150 and 200 million years (Stephens 2001).  

The following paragraph is an excerpt from an influential paper (Davies
et al. 2004):

>“Charles Darwin described the rapid rise and diversification within the angiosperms as an ‘abominable mystery.’ Angiosperms are regarded as one of the greatest terrestrial radiations of recent geological times. The major lineages originated 130-90 million years ago (mya), followed by a dramatic rise to ecological dominance 100-70 mya. Approximately 250000 extant species have been recognised, although estimates vary, and the final number might be double this. Within the group, sister clades can differ in species richness over several orders of magnitude. Darwin attempted to identify a single causal explanation for the rapid diversification of angiosperms but described his own efforts as wretchedly poor.”

Through  recent research, we have come a long way in understanding the evolutionary relationship among orders and families  of flowering plants. The figure shows a phylogeny of flowering plants (a
 tree showing how flowering plant orders are related to one another).


![The evolutionary relationships among the orders of vascular plants. From http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/](tree.png)

\newpage

## Make sure you know the key terms:  

1. **Most recent common ancester** 

2. **Clade** (a group of organisms that contains all descendents from a common evolutionary ancestor; **taxon** (plural: taxa) is a synonym of clade)

3. **Speciation rate**

4. **Extinction rate**

5. **Sister group**--Sister groups or "sister taxa" are just what they sound like--two
groups the diverged from each other, with each being the other's closest relative.  Gymnosperms are angiosperms closest relative and vice versa.  The ferns are sister to the seed plants.  Fagales (the oak order) and Cucurbitales (the cucumber order) are sister groups.  However, this gets more complicated as some taxa do not have accepted names.  Rosales is sister to Cucurbitales + Fagales, which is a group that does not have its own name.  

6. **Monophyletic** a group of organisms that contains all descendents from a common evolutionary ancestor; primates is one example of a monophyletic group that contains *you*.  If a plant family is found not to be monophyletic, taxonomists break it up to try to create monophyletic plant families.  This is usually why taxonomy changes through time.

7. **Paraphyletic** (see figure)

8. **Family** in plants these all end in *-aceae*; every family is in an order; in plants families *usually* have diagnostic features

9. **Order** in plants these end in *-ales*; unlike families orders are so diverse that there are usually not diagnostic features

![A way to talk about phylogenies](monophyly.jpg)

![Here is a phylogeny with the model organisms (usually food plants) highlighted](modeltree3.gif)

![Here is another phylogeny of the angiosperms with specific species at the tips highlighted.  The grey doughnuts each represent 50 Million Years so you can see the scale of plant evolution.  Phylogeny from Werner, Cornwell et al. 2014.](n-fixers.jpg)

\newpage

### Three key web resources that curate data on flowering plant diversity:

The Atlas of Living Australia:  (http://www.ala.org.au/)

and

The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website: (http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/)

and 

The Plant List: (http://www.theplantlist.org/)

### You will now use these two web resources (and anything else you can find on the web) to build a powerpoint slideshow (roughly 5 slides).  

**Make sure to cite the source for all data in your slideshow**

Here are the steps to producing this slideshow:

1. Find one native plant species that is found close to somewhere you know well, e.g. your home.  Pick a species that you like, since you'll proceed to do some research on it.  Everyone should pick a different species.  Don't pick the same one as your neighbor.   (Include in the slideshow the latitude and longitude of the species observation from ALA).

2. Which state(s) is this species found in (check ALA)?

3. Which family is this species in?

4. Write down the traits of the flower (or plant) that would allow you to tell that the plant is in this family.

5. Which order is this species in? 

6. The number of species in this genus in the world (check the plant list).

7. The number of species in this genus in Australia.

8. The number of species in this family in the world. (Is this family relatively diverse or species poor? Is this number of species relatively high or low?)

9. The number of species in this family in Australia. (Is this family relatively diverse or species poor? Is this number of species relatively high or low?)

10. The sister family(s) of your plant's family (check the phylogenies on APWeb).

11. Modeled on the pictures of phylogenies in the lab, draw a phylogeny (with lines in powerpoint or whatever drawing program you like) that contains your plant species, *Zea mays*, *Solanum tuberosum*, *Eucalyptus regnans*, *Pisum sativum*, and *Pinus radiata*. (Remember phylogenies don't have to contain all the species--it's OK to draw a phylogeny of just a few to show the relationships among those 6 species.)

12. Place picture of each plant at the "tip" of the phylogeny (ALA or google image)

13. Remember a phylogeny is a representation of history.  How long ago was the most recent common ancester of all the species in your phylogeny?  Place a rough scale bar (in millions of years) on your phylogeny (hint: look for dates/ages on APWeb)

# Week 10: Germination, Seeds And Fruits 

Fruits and seeds play an essential role in the reproduction of most
plants. As well as being reproductive structures they also have
functions in the dispersal of plants, and, in many cases, survival
through periods of adverse conditions. In this practical you will look
at germination in seeds and you are provided with an introduction to
some of the diversity of fruits found in the Angiosperms.

## Germination

 There are two major modes of germination:

 1. **Hypogeal**, where the cotyledons remain below the ground and the
 shoot is raised into the light by elongation of the *epicotyl* (the internode above the
 cotyledons);

 2. **Epigeal**, where the cotyledons emerge above the ground and may
 become the first photosynthetic organs. (In this case the internode below the
 cotyledons, the *hypocotyl*, elongates.)

 Germinated seeds of a number of species are provided. Determine the
 type of germination for each species. Construct a table to indicate
 mode of germination, primary storage area and persistence of
 cotyledons for the species provided.

Compare the nature and type of food reserves in the following:-

 1. barley (*Hordeum vulgare*)

 2. tomato (*Lycopersicum esculentum*)

 You will need to section the seeds provided (take care, and if
 necessary, support the seed in the carrot provided for sectioning) and
 stain the sections with the following dyes:-

 *Sudan Black B*

 This is a standard lipid stain.

 Lipid bodies, cuticle and the Casparian band of the exodermis stain
 black.

 *Amido Black*

 - Stain freshly cut sections for about 5 minutes. 

 - Rinse in distilled
 water.

 - Mount in glycerol

 *Protein bodies and other protein-containing areas should stain a deep
 blue-black.*

 *Toluidine Blue* should be used to stain phosphorus reserves.

 *Iodine* stains starch.

  Examine the prepared slides of germinated barley.

- What indications are there that mobilisation of the endosperm reserves
 has already begun?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- What features of the aleurone layer suggest the role of this tissue?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

- You are provided with a berry, a drupe and an indehiscent fruit. In
    each case identify the various layers present in the pericarp. What
    was the nature of the ovary from which each of the fruits was
    derived?

\vspace*{3\baselineskip}

 A range of fruits is provided. Using the Key and descriptions try
to identify the type to which each fruit may be assigned.

Determine whether each fruit is a simple, aggregate or multiple fruit.
If simple, try to find out whether it was the product of a superior or inferior ovary.

Try to determine the number of carpels incorporated into each fruit, and
the placentation of their ovules. For this it may be necessary to start
your investigations by taking a transverse section through the fruit (a
longitudinal section is rarely informative). In many cases fusion and
abortion of parts during development obscures the picture which can only
be resolved if a full developmental sequence from flower to fruit is
available. For example, a coconut is developed from a tricarpellary
ovary in which two of the locules have aborted.

## Fruit Types

>"...it may be right to say that there are as many sorts of fruits as
>there are major groupings of genera. This means thousands of kinds, and
>indeed, several hundred specialised names have already been proposed;
>the result is another specialist language in the babel of science,
>through which the student must break." - E.J. Corner 1964 'The Life of Plants'

The strict definition of a *fruit* would be that it is the product of
the post-fertilizaton development of a pistil. However, it is more
convenient to adopt a functional concept and include as part of the
fruit tissues of extra carpellary origin so that the fruit is the
post-fertilization development of the flower. [In some books you will
find fruit containing tissues of extra carpellary origins referred to as
"false fruit". Thus the strawberry (not a berry but an aggregate fruit)
is said to be a false fruit because the fleshy part is derived from the
receptacle. Even the fruits of *Eucalyptus* are sometimes called false
because, derived from a half inferior flower, the cup of the fruit is
extra carpellary. For most purposes making the distinction between true
and false fruits is unnecessary.]

Several classifications of fruit types have been proposed of varying
complexity. The terminology is, unfortunately, not necessarily
consistent between classifications. Many of the names of fruit types
refer to specialised forms produced by particular families; some of
these special types are of great economic importance so that the names
are widely known, many other special names can be conveniently ignored.

An artificial classification of fruits which is widely used would be as
follows:

**Simple fruit:** a fruit derived from a single pistil or from a single
carpel disseminated singly.

**Aggregate fruit:** a fruit derived from many free carpels of a
*single* flower.

**Multiple fruit:** a fruit derived from the carpels of many individual
flowers crowded together on the same axis.

### Simple Fruits

A simple fruit is derived from the ripening of a simple or compound ovary in a flower with only one pistil.  Note that there may be more than one carpel and more than one seed within a simple fruit.

 A fruit is **dry** when the pericarp is papery, leathery or woody at
 maturity and **fleshy** if the pericarp becomes succulent or fibrous.
 Dry fruit may be **dehiscent** if the pericarp splits, or opens by
 means of pores, to shed the seeds and **indehiscent** if the pericarp
 does not open.

 Fleshy fruits are virtually all indehiscent.

### Dry dehiscent fruits

 **FOLLICLE** - product of a single superior carpel containing one or
 many seeds and splitting down one side of the fruit only - e.g. *Telopea* (waratah),
 *Xylomelum* (woody pear).

**LEGUME** - product of a single superior carpel containing many seeds
 and splitting at maturity along both sides (along the carpel margins
 and the median-vein). Dehiscence is often explosive, ejecting the
 seeds. This is the characteristic fruit of the Leguminosae (Fabaceae).

**CAPSULE** - fruit developed from a number of fused carpels which
 open along a number of

 sutures or by pores, e.g. *Eucalyptus.* A **siliqua** is the capsule
 characteristic of the Cruciferae (Brassicaceae) - it is a capsule that
 has two valves (from two fused carpels) which separate from a
 persistent central partition (septum) to which the seeds are attached.

### Dry Indehiscent fruits

 **ACHENE** - product of a single superior carpel with one seed which
 is free from the pericarp except at the placenta, e.g. *Ranunculus*. A
 **cypsela** is an achene derived from an inferior ovary; the term
 appears to be restricted to the Compositae (Asteraceae).

**SAMARA** - a winged achene; the wing is an extension of the pericarp
 and presumably assists in dispersal, e.g. *Fraxinus* (ash). The fruit
 of the sycamore often given as an example of a samara is really a
 schizocarp (q.v.).

**CARYOPSIS** - product of a unilocular, superior ovary with one seed,
 but the wall of the ovary (pericarp) and the seed coat (testa) are
 fused together; characteristic of the family Gramineae.

**NUT** - one-seeded fruit with a hard, woody pericarp, e.g. *Quercus*
(acorn), *Corylus* (hazelnut). Most of the nuts of commerce are not true
nuts but are the seeds or stones of fruits.

**SCHIZOCARP** - usually the product of several joined carpels which
separate when ripe, but each carpel remains indehiscent. Each carpel
contains one seed, free from the pericarp except at the placenta, e.g.
*Geranium*, the *Apiaceae*, *Acer*. The separate segments are called
**mericarps**. In a sense schizocarps are intermediate between dehiscent
and indehiscent fruits.

**LOMENTUM** - formed from a single carpel with many ovules, that
separates into a number of one-seeded sections - found in a number of
Fabaceae.

### Fleshy fruits

**DRUPE** - the pericarp is differentiated into three zones: an outer
*epicarp*, a middle succulent or fibrous *mesocarp* and an inner
lignified *endocarp*; the endocarp and the contained seed(s) form the
*pyrene* (stone). Most commonly formed from a single superior carpel as
in *Prunus* spp. (peaches, cherries, etc.), but multicarpellary origins
occur, e.g. *Lantana* and sometimes the drupe is pseudomonomerous
through abortion, e.g. *Cocos* (coconut).

**BERRY** - pericarp two-layered, lacking the woody endocarp; usually a
many-seeded fruit formed from a number of fused carpels (inferior or
superior), e.g. *Musa* (banana), *Cucurbita* (pumpkin); sometimes
one-seeded, e.g. *Phoenix* (date), (many so-called "berries" -
strawberry, blackberry, raspberry, are not berries). 

A **POME** is a particular kind of berry characteristic of certain members of the
Rosaceae (apples, pears) - the five inferior carpels are free on their
inner edges (the hole in the core) and their outer walls and the
enlarged enclosing receptacle forms the flesh of the fruit.  Pomes, and berries in general, are often yummy.

###Aggregate fruits

An aggregate fruit is  derived from many free carpels of a *single* flower; the carpels are not joined together, i.e. each pistil contains one carpel.  Often the
 carpels are held together by a persistent floral receptacle which itself
 may be elaborated to form a substantial accessory part of the fruit.

1. *Receptacle tissue not fleshy*, e.g. *Rubus* (raspberry, blackberry)
where the individual fruits are small drupes borne on a non-succulent
receptacle.

2. *Receptacle tissue fleshy*, e.g. *Fragaria* (strawberry) where the
individual fruits are achenes borne on a succulent receptacle and *Rosa*
(the rose) where the rosehip consists of achenes enclosed in a fleshy
cup-shaped receptale (a *hip*).

###Multiple fruits

Multiple fruits are derived from many pistils or carpels of *many individual
flowers crowded together on the same inflorescence* axis. The
inflorescence axis and frequently also the basal parts of all floral
segments as well as the floral receptacle and pedicel are necessarily
incorporated in the fruit)

e.g.:*Syncarpia* (Turpentine) has a fruit formed from a fused cyme with
seven capsules. *Ananas* (pineapple) fruit is a number of fused berries
and the axis of the inflorescence (a spike), the bases of the subtending
bract and the flower stalks have all become succulent.

# Long-term Assignments

## The Plant Collection

See details at the end of the lab manual for plant collection
guidelines. While the collection is not due until week 8, specimens take some time to both dry and identify.  We suggest
that you begin work on this project as soon as possible.

## Research in Botany

There are three options for this assignment.

1. Write a research proposal (see ideas for topics at the back of the lab manual)

2.  A species report.  In this assignment you will take (at least) weekly notes about the morphology and physiology of one plant individual through the term.  This may include photographs and data collection, and need to include written observations.  These observations should be uploaded weekly to moodle.  This will be supplemented with an ecological and conservation report on your species.  

3.  A 3--minute video (groups of up to two) about a cool species from your collection or about some cool area of plant biology you want to explain in a visually engaging way to a general audience.  

For all projects a one-page proposal is due at the last lecture of week 3.  This is simply a plan for what you are going to work on.    For the research proposal identify the topic.  
For the tree journal you should find the tree that your will take repeated observations at, and have already identified it.  For the video project you should have a rough outline of the idea for the video and why it will be super cool.

The one-page proposal is assessed, so prepare it professionally.  We will both mark and give you feedback on the ideas.

### Start these assignments early!!!

\newpage

# Plant Collection Guidelines

As part of this course, you will be required to produce a small
herbarium style plant collection. Plant collections are used by
scientists in much the same way as animal specimens in museums.
Preserved plants in herbaria can be used as a reference and aid to plant
identification, a record of extant and extinct populations, a record of
the expansion of invasive species, a source of DNA for molecular biology
studies, and a source of morphological and architectural data for
regional and global comparative studies. The School of BEES has a
herbarium consisting of about 50 000 preserved specimens and other
botanical resources on the fourth floor
(http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/research/facilities/herbarium). After the
course is completed, you may keep your collection or you may choose to
donate your specimens to our herbarium. Your specimens will either be
incorporated into our collection or donated to other local or
international herbaria.

### Rules

There are a number of rules which apply to making a plant collection.
Without a license, it is illegal (with potentially large fines) to
collect any plant which is included on the schedule of the Threatened
Species Conservation Act (see
[www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au](http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au)) or
the Environmental and Biodiversity Conservation Act (see
[www.ea.gov.au](http://www.ea.gov.au)) or which is a protected species
on Schedule 13 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act (this includes,
for example, all species of *Boronia* and all orchids). It is also
illegal to collect plants from national parks, nature reserves, state
recreation areas or any other protected area (this includes the Royal
Botanical Gardens). Collections breaking any of these rules will not be
accepted.

*Here are the general guidelines for your collection:*

1. Your collection will consist of FIFTEEN specimens from at least eight different plant families. A minimum of six of these must be woody species (trees or shrubs)

2.  Only collect flowering plants (angiosperms), do not collect gymnosperms or ferns.

3.  Your specimens should include at least one specimen displaying:
    -   An inferior ovary
    -   A superior ovary
    -   Compound leaves
    -   Bilaterally symmetrical flowers
    -   Radially symmetrical flowers
    -   Cladodes
    -   Stipules

4.  **Collect native or naturalised plants**. Horticultural plants are
    often difficult to identify and collecting them would not contribute
    to our knowledge base of the Australian flora. If you are looking
    for plants near gardens – **Don’t** collect plants that have been
    put there by people; **Do** collect plants (such as weeds) that
    arrived there on their own.

### Collecting Instructions

1.  Bring a note book, a pair of clippers, plant tags, and a large
    plastic bag with you when collecting.  Optional: a GPS or smart phone that includes a GPS.  

2.  When you find a plant you wish to collect, make careful note of the
    habitat (e.g. woodland, park, grassy field, rock outcrop, etc), and the
    location.  The location may be either the latitude and longitude from a GPS or 
     the names of nearby oads, pathways, parks,
    and neighbourhoods. This information should allow another scientist to
    find the population as easily as possible.  Also include the growth habit of the plant (tree, shrub, vine,
    herb, etc.), plant height (approximately), and the approximate size
    of the population.

3.  Collect a sample of the plant. Make sure your specimen shows leaves,
    stem, and flowers and/or fruit. For smaller plants you may wish to
    collect the entire individual. Collect healthy looking plants.
    Specimens should be collected by making a clean cut off the stem
    (ripping branches off produces large wounds, which may be invaded by
    pathogens). Put your specimens in the plastic bag.

4.  You may wish to try to identify the specimens while fresh. They
    should stay relatively fresh for a day or two if the bag is stored
    in a cool place (your refrigerator).

5.  Arrange your plants on newspaper and stack in the plant press. We
    will demonstrate this in the lab. Try to press your plants as soon
    as possible after collection (although called a press, the aim is to
    provide a means of drying plants, not to squash them as flat as
    possible).

6.  Dry your plants. This can be done by different methods. We have some
    drying facilities in the herbarium you can use. If they are pressed
    correctly, your plants should dry in any well ventilated area.
    Remember to replace the news print and blotting paper on your
    specimens regularly, this will minimize the drying time. Large
    irregular structures (like Banksia inflorescences) may need to be
    sliced before pressing.

7.  Display each specimen on a completed herbarium sheet. We will show
    you examples of mounted specimens.

8.  Submit a spreadsheet documenting the distribution of character
    states amongst the specimens

Here’s what we will be marking:

1.  Complete and correct identification. This includes family name,
    genus, specific epithet and authority. Common names are not
    required.

2.  Complete data. This includes habitat description, location,
    additional information for this specimen (e.g. height, growth form
    (e.g. tree or herb) population size estimate, flower or fruit
    colour), your name, collection date, and specimen number. *We will
    supply labels for each of your specimens with space for the required
    information.*

3.  Complete specimen. Each plant must show flowers or fruit (preferably
    both), stem, and leaves. Press enough material to fill roughly half
    a folded sheet of news paper (Sydney Morning Herald size). Large
    herbs should be (where possible) folded, not cut. Woody plants
    should be trimmed so that critical characteristics are present.

4.  Diversity. Plants displaying the character states listed in part 3
    (above) should be included. Eight separate families must be
    represented within your collection. There will likely be bonus marks
    where each specimen represents a different family. A minimum of six
    specimens must be woody species.

# Research in Botany project

When not teaching courses, academics and research scientists spend a
great deal of time writing grant applications to agencies that support
scientific research (e.g. the Australian Research Council – the ARC).
Preparing these applications typically involves synthesising some of the
important literature in the field and proposing the next big important
step. Any of you who continue with careers in the sciences (academic,
government, or private sector) will spend a great deal of time writing
grants similar to what you will do in this project. The format of your
submission is extremely similar to the format of ARC grant applications
– most of your lecturers will be writing very similar applications after
the end of session.

***Project goals*:**

1)  ***To link some of the fundamental topics in botany you are
    > currently examining in the lectures and practicals with current
    > and cutting edge research in botany.***

2)  ***To expose you to some of the requirements of being a research
    > scientist.***

3)  ***To build your skills in conducting research and communicating new
    > ideas***

***The project***

You are all at the very early stages of what should be long careers in
biological research. I do not expect that you will become experts in
your field or even understand all of the literature you read. To help
you with developing your projects, I have listed some potential research
projects (on blackboard). Each of these projects links some of the
fundamental information you have seen in the course with current
research activity in botany. Most of these projects are also linked to
issues of pressing global concern, such as climate change and food
production. For each project, I give a short background, provide some
key questions that can be the focus of new research, and some references
to get you started. You are not limited to these projects, I will be
happy to work with you to develop a project that interests you. It does
have to focus, in some way, to research in botany.

Most research projects are developed as a team of researchers. *I
encourage you to work in a group* – I don’t have an upper limit to the
number in each research team. In my experience, groups larger than 4
people start to get unwieldy and ineffective, so try to keep your team
to 4 or fewer students. You may also work on this project by yourself.

The projects are not limited to a single group. Every group can pick the
same project if they wish (so long as each group works independently).

Everybody in your research team will receive the same mark.

I will arrange to have group areas included on the flowering plants
Moodle page.

***Exploring Scientific Literature***

As part of this project, you will spend some time reading published
scientific literature. I know that would be asking too much for you to
have an immediate grasp of articles in advanced scientific fields. Thus,
for each project, I have selected a small number of articles that will
introduce you to a topic with (hopefully) a minimum of jargon or
statistics.

You can find more/related literature from a database on our library
resource page called web of science (to get to this resource, you can
follow the ‘sirius’ link to log into your resources area on the library
page. From there, you can search for ‘web of science’. Web of science
will allow you to conduct general searches for scientific articles using
search terms (just like google). Once you find an article of interest,
you can link to all of the articles citing your article, and all the
articles your article has cited. You can do a quick and comprehensive
search for all the literature in a given topic using this tool! *Having
problems using this database? I will help you.*

You can also use web searches to explore a given topic. Try to stick to
trusted areas on the web (e.g. government and university web pages) –
there are a lot of crackpot ideas out there.

***Marking the projects***

Research in Botany is worth 15% of your final mark.

1)  Short project summary (at the end of week 5) 3 %

2)  Final project submission (at the end of week 11) 12 %

I will be marking these projects based on the project goals listed
above.

***Potential projects will be posted on Moodle in week 1 or 2.***

# Practical Skills

Practical work is an important component of this course. Apart from
illustrating lecture material, it should teach you:

 \(a) how to handle and prepare plant material for study;

 \(b) how to make observations, both qualitatively and quantitatively;

 \(c) how to record those observations so that they are meaningful to
 others; observations must be clearly recorded so that they can be communicated
 to those who have not themselves examined the material.

## Special Skill: Cutting and Staining

*GENERAL*

Plant structure is studied most often by cutting thin sections of the
plant and examining them stained or unstained with the light microscope.
The plant material to be sectioned may be living or 'fixed', which means
that the material has been treated with a carefully chosen chemical that
gels cell proteins and preserves intracellular structure with as little
distortion as possible of the living state.

Sectioning can be done by hand with a razor blade, or by using a
mechanical cutting device (a microtome) that holds the material and
advances it a section-thick distance after each slice of the knife.
Usually for microtome sectioning material is first impregnated with wax
or plastic which is then solidified around and within the tissue to
strengthen it during cutting. On hardening, a 'block' is formed with the
specimen 'embedded' within a matrix of supporting material. Both tissue
and embedding matrix are sectioned together and the extra support allows
thinner sections to be cut, resulting in better resolution of tissue
structure.

### Sectioning By Hand

You will require:

1. a Petri dish or watch glass with a 0.5 cm depth of water;

2. a small paint-brush;

3. a *new* razor-blade (carefully protect its cutting edge all the time).

Hold the material with your left (or non-dextrous) hand so that the
plane of cutting will be horizontal. The aim is to cut smoothly and
fairly quickly producing dozens of sections from which a few are chosen:
it is worth noting that it is often the incomplete sections with thin
'running-out' edges that provide the best study. The razor blade surface
should be wet with one or two drops of water to prevent the newly-cut
sections from drying out. When several sections mount up on the blade
they are swept carefully off with the wet paint-brush into the water in
the Petri dish.

**Do not let the material dry out at any stage.**

### Staining Schedules

Place the staining solution in a watch glass. Prepare a second watch
glass about 2/3 full of distilled water ready for rinsing. After
staining the specimen for the appropriate time transfer it to the rinse
solution. Note that staining times are usually critical, but sections
can often be held in rinse water for several hours without damage.

**All stains should be treated as potential carcinogens and you should
take care not to stain yourself. To protect skin and clothes from
accidental staining please wipe up any spills immediately.**

Schedules for the stains you will use are outlined below.

### Mounting Sections

Always place a cover-slip over the section before examining it under the
microscope. Sections can be mounted either in water or 50% glycerol. The
advantage of glycerol is that it evaporates less quickly. However, if
the preparation is drying out an additional drop of mounting solution
can be added easily without removing the cover-slip, by carefully
touching the drop (on a needle, pencil or pipette) against the edge of
the cover-slip and allowing the liquid to flow under the cover-slip.

(Plastic-embedded sections are often mounted in oil or other non-aqueous
media, rather than water: this gives improved resolution.)

### Staining Schedules

- *Toluidine Blue*** (MULTIPLE STAIN).

Toluidine Blue is a very important dye that distinguishes lignified
 from unlignified walls. It is a positively charged dye which stains negative groups.
 Lignified walls stain blue and unlignified walls stain pink or purple.
 The pectin and hemicellulose fractions of the wall stain pink.
 Cellulose does not stain.

More detailed staining reactions are given below:

### Cell Chemical Group That Staining Structure Reacts With Colour

1.  cytoplasm (phosphate groups in nucleic acids) purple

2.  nucleus (phosphate groups in DNA) blue

3.  cell walls (COOH groups in some unlignified carbohydrates e.g. pectin) pink

1.  lignified walls (phenols) green to blue (turquoise blue)

2.  some vacuoles (phenols) deep dark blue

### Staining Schedule

1. Wash section in distilled water (5 min.).

2. Transfer to a drop of toluidine blue in a watch glass.

3. Leave until you can see differentiation of pink and blue tissue (seconds to minutes).

4. Transfer to distilled water in a second watch glass for a few seconds to wash out excess stain. Check stain. If OK, then

5. Transfer to a clean dry slide in a drop of glycerol. Cover with a clean cover-slip, lowered gently from one side to exclude air bubbles.

### Safranin and Fast Green

Many prepared slides are stained with these two dyes. Safranin (red) is
preferentially retained in lignified, suberized, or cutinised walls, as
well as in regions rich in DNA or RNA (ie. nuclei), whereas Fast green
stains protein (and, particularly, primary walls). Both stains are also
fast (ie. permanent) on clothing and to a lesser extent on fingers, so
should be used with care, and any spills mopped up with paper towel.

### Iodine in KI (STARCH).

- Iodine stains starch grains bright purple to blue-black.

- Wash briefly in distilled water.

- Transfer section to a drop of iodine on a slide.

- Leave for 2-5 minutes.

- Blot off the stain and add a drop of glycerine.

- Cover with a cover-slip, lowered gently from one side to exclude all air bubbles.

**Note:** Although Iodine is widely used as a disinfectant, some people
are highly allergic to it. Treat all stains with care and do not allow
them to come in contact with your skin.

# Light Microscopy

### Olympus Microscope

**Operating procedure**

1. Place the microscope in a comfortable position on the bench.

2. Check that on/off switch (right hand side of base) is in the off
position and the brightness control is at zero.

3. Plug in and switch on at the centre of the bench.

4. Turn on microscope lamp and increase brightness control until you can
see some light coming through the condenser.

5. Make sure the 4x objective is in position.

6. Place specimen slide on stage and hold in position with stage clip.
THE SPECIMEN SHOULD NEVER BE VIEWED WITHOUT A COVERSLIP.

7. Position specimen under 4x objective using mechanical stage controls.

8. Focus. Adjust brightness control if necessary.

9. Make interpupillary and diopter adjustments (see below).

10. Swing in desired objective. Re-focus.

11. Check that condenser height is optimum (should be raised above image
of ground glass screen).

12. Close iris diaphragm to 2/3 (70%) of the exit pupil of objective
(see below).

13. Fine focus and observe.

**Correct setting up of the microscope *will be examined* in the
practical examination.**

*How to correct interpupillary distance and diopter settings*

1. Hold the knurled dovetail slides of the right and left eyepiece tubes
with both hands and put the tubes together, or pull them apart
laterally, whichever is required, while looking through the eyepieces
with both eyes, until perfect binocular vision is obtained.

2. Rotate the tube length adjustment ring on the right eyepiece tube to
match your interpupillary distance setting, which is given on the scale
above and left of the right hand eyepiece.

3. Look at the image through the right hand eyepiece with your right eye
and focus on the specimen with the coarse and fine adjustment knobs.

4. Next, looking at the image through the left eyepiece with your left
eye rotate the tube length of this eyepiece to focus on the specimen
without altering the coarse and fine adjustment knobs.

### Automatic pre-focussing

This lever (inside ring of left hand focusing knob) locks the microscope
at a particular coarse focus position to prevent further upward travel
of the stage by means of the coarse adjustment knob. It prevents damage
to objectives as a result of focusing the specimen slide up through the
objective lens. It does not restrict fine focusing.

### Aperture iris diaphragm

The lever on the condenser controls the aperture iris diaphragm
adjustment. The iris diaphragm should be adjusted to match the numerical
aperture of the objective in use in order to get the best result.
However, since the image usually lacks contrast a compromise is made and
the diaphragm is stopped down to about 70% of the objective numerical
aperture.

Remove the eyepieces: the circle of light represents the exit pupil of
the objective. Adjust the diaphragm using the condenser lever until the
iris impinges on the exit pupil by about 1/3. This should always be done
when objectives are changed.


### Dos and don'ts

1. If lenses are dirty you may clean them, but only with either a blower
brush or a fresh piece of lens tissue - NOT KLEENEX. (Xylene, alcohol or
ether may be used in small amounts as a cleaning fluid.)

2. When carrying the microscope, keep it upright so that the eyepieces
do not fall out. USE BOTH HANDS.

3. The tension on the coarse focus can be altered by rotating the
innermost ring on the right-hand focus adjustment knob.

4. DO NOT TWIST THE TWO COARSE ADJUSTMENT KNOBS IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
SIMULTANEOUSLY AS THIS WILL CAUSE DAMAGE.

5. Do not spill water, oil or acid on the mechanical stage or any other
part of the microscope. Oil or water between the slide and stage causes
friction so that the slide will not move easily.

### Calibration of the microscope and making measurements

*Simple calibration calculations are usually on the board at the front
of the lab.*

All microscopes are equipped with a micrometer eyepiece. This contains a
glass graticule with a scale engraved at the centre. It has been
inserted into the eyepiece and should be visible when you look through
the microscope.

The value of the micrometer eyepiece changes as the magnification
changes and it should be calibrated for each objective with a stage
micrometer. The stage micrometer scale is usually 1.0 mm long,
subdivided into 100 X .01 mm (10 µm) divisions. To calibrate the
eyepiece micrometer you need to determine the number of divisions on the
stage micrometer that corresponds to a chosen number of divisions of the
eyepiece micrometer.

The relationship is: $M = \frac{S \times V} {E}$

M is the value (in mm or µm) of *each* eyepiece micrometer unit to be
determined.

V is the value of each stage micrometer unit (usually 0.01 mm).

S & E are the numbers of units on the stage and eyepiece micrometers,
respectively, that correspond.

Once the value of M has been determined for a particular magnification,
the eyepiece micrometer may then be used in the same way as a ruler.

The measurement is actually made by carefully lining up the two scales
and counting the number of divisions in each that corresponds. The
calibration should be done for each objective and the value recorded for
future reference.

![Diagram of a light microscope](microscope.png)

## Botanical drawing

In this course we are not asking you to produce works of art (or
imagination), but accurate representations of what you can see down the
microscope. You are all capable of this - the principal requirements are
practice and a sharp pencil (preferably HB).

There are two types of drawing, and *each should be accompanied by a
scale:

![In a low power plan individual cells should not appear. The aim is to
 indicate boundaries between different tissues. Clearly you will need
 to introduce some simplification into such a diagram. For example,
 boundaries with many small scale convolutions may be portrayed as a
 straight line and diffuse boundaries by dotted lines.](LowPowerPlan.png)

### High Power Drawing

 This should be an accurate drawing of a small number of cells. It
 should show details of cell outline and as much internal structure as
 is discernable. For example, if you are drawing a cell with
 chloroplasts, you should draw them in the correct position to the
 correct size, shape and number: they should not be drawn as a vague
 collection of squiggles around the edge of the cell. Cell walls, if
 accurately represented, will rarely have breaks in them.

 Thick cell walls should be represented by a double line, and thin cell
 walls by a single line. You can use the distance between the two
 "double" lines to indicate wall thickness. Each cell should be
 enclosed by a completed line. See these points in the example below.
 Note how the thick walls of the epidermis, collenchyma and fibres are
 separated from intercellular space.

 ![An example of a good high power drawing](HighPowerDiagram.png)

## Constructing a scale

 A scale must be of a rounded-off length (eg. 10 m, 50 m, 100 m, or
 0.5mm or 1mm) that readily allows the viewer to calculate the real
 size of the whole structure and its parts.

### STEPS:

1.  Measure (on the section) an *easily recognisable part* of the
    drawing using the ocular micrometer eg. the radial diameter of a vascular bundle = 54 units on the X4
 objective

2. Calculate the actual size: (ie. multiply occular units by the length each represents on the objective used)
eg. 54 x 25 =1350 µm (or 1.35mm)

3. Measure the size of *the same part* on the drawing (ie. the diameter of the same bundle) eg. 76mm

4. Since 76mm on the drawing represents 1350µm on the section, what
 distance on the drawing equals 1mm (1000µm) on the section?

 1 m = *76* therefore 1000µm = *76* x1000 = 55.9mm

 1350 1350

5. Draw a scale line 56mm long below the drawing and label it 1mm
 (ie.1000µm).

### General points

1. Make drawings large.

2. All drawings should have a heading stating organ, species and plane
of section.

3. All drawings should be in pencil. It is also highly desirable that
labels should be in pencil so that corrections can be made easily and
neatly.

4. Labels should appear to the side of a drawing and not be written
across it. A *straight* line, and not an arrow, should connect the label to the area it refers to -
the labels should be arranged in such a way that the lines do not cross.
Labels should give detailed information about composition of structures
where possible, based on staining reactions, eg. lignified wall.

5. It is usually not necessary to use cross-hatching or stippling to
indicate particular tissue types in low power diagrams. If you must
clarify your drawings by cross-hatching, make sure it is neat and does
not cross the boundary line of the tissue. An example of the use of
shading is given on page 12.

6. The scale of all drawings should be indicated (see instructions for
constructing a scale above).

7. In labelling a drawing a certain amount of interpretation is
necessary. Under some circumstances, interpretation of certain features of transverse sections
may require confirmation from longitudinal sections.

8. While drawing you should be constantly altering the plane of focus of
the microscope in order to clarify details. You should also be prepared to change the
objective: to a higher power to help the interpretation of fine detail;
to a lower power to appreciate the relationship of what you are drawing
to the structure of the whole organ.

9. In this course we hope to improve your skills of observation and
interpretation. In some exercises it will be left to you (with advice from your demonstrator) to
decide what sections to cut, what stains to use and how to present the
evidence. Drawings alone may be inadequate to record some observations;
supplement by notes or tables when appropriate. It is not desirable to
include too many notes in the labels.

# Important Australian Families and Subfamilies

**NB.** The key characters for recognising the family are underlined in
these notes.

## Family Myrtaceae - The Eucalypt family.

A family of about 120 genera and 3,200 species (ranks 11th amongst the
Angiosperms in number of species). It is worldwide in distribution, but
is particularly well represented in Australia and Central America.

Habit: Woody plants, mostly trees and shrubs (no herbs).

Leaves: *Simple, entire and exstipulate*; mostly opposite, but many
Australian members have alternate leaves. The mesophyll usually contains
*translucent oil-glands*, so that the leaves are mostly fragrant when
crushed.

Flowers: Actinomorphic with the sepals, petals and stamens arising from
a receptacular cup that is fused to the sides of the ovary and mostly
arises above it; hence the *ovary is half-inferior*. The perianth is
4-5-merous, while the *stamens are numerous* and often indefinite in
number, providing much of the floral display.

Fruits: There are two basic kinds -

1. *A fleshy berry or drupe* - ovary 2 or more locular. This type
 characterises the sub-family Myrtoideae, which is widespread in the
 tropics; their leaves are always opposite. This is considered the more
 primitive (or less specialised) group in the family. In Australia its
 members are restricted to the closed forests of moister regions of the
 east and north.

2. A dry and often woody dehiscent structure with 1 or more locules *(a
 capsule*), or a dry unilocular indehiscent fruit (*an achene*). These
 types occur in the sub-family Leptospermoideae, which is mainly
 Australasian, and in which the leaves may be opposite or alternate. This
  sub-family is considered a specialisation that developed in Australia
 during the Tertiary in response to the increasing aridity of the
 continent. Some genera have spread to neighbouring regions in relatively
 recent time (eg., *Leptospermum* to New Zealand, *Melaleuca* to New
 Guinea and Malaysia, *Eucalyptus* to Timor, New Guinea and The
 Philippines).

*Notes: An unusual feature of the family is that the stems and leaves
have phloem on both sides of the xylem.*

###Important genera in Australia:

- *Syzygium* Gaertn. and *Acmena* DC, with fleshy fruits.

- *Eucalyptus* L'Herit., *Corymbia* Hill & Johnson (previously included in *Eucalyptus*), *Angophora* Cav. (similar to eucalypts, but having sepals and petals in the flower, and always with opposite leaves)

- *Leptospermum* Forst. f. (Tea Trees)

- *Melaleuca* L. (Paperbarks - stamens fused into bundles in the flower) and 

- *Callistemon* R. Br. (Bottlebrushes - stamens free), with woody capsules.

### ID Excercises

1. Examine the leaves from one of the specimens provided. Are they simple
 or compound? Is the leaf margin toothed or entire? Take a leaf, hold
 it up and look through the leaf against the light (window). Can you
 see translucent dots or patches in the mesophyll? Look from both
 surfaces. These are **multicellular oil glands**. Crush the leaf
 thoroughly in a clean hand and sniff. Does it have a distinctive
 smell? What does the smell remind you of? *Simple entire leaves*
 containing such glands are characteristic of this family.

2. Examine a flower. Note the **radial** symmetry. How many stamens are
 present? Is the number constant from flower to flower, and does it
 relate simply to the number of petals and sepals (eg., equal or double
 the number)? Which parts provide the main ‘display’ of the flower:
 petals, or stamens?

3. Note the single undivided style in the centre. Is the ovary clearly
 visible inside the floral cup. Cut a flower along a sagittal section
 (vertically along an axis of symmetry), and examine the cut face with
 your hand lens. Note the locules of the ovary embedded within the
 receptacle either side of the base of the style. The ovary is termed
 **half-inferior**. This condition occurs throughout the family.

 4. Examine the attachment of the petals and stamens to the receptacle
 around the edge of the top of the ovary. Does each stamen and petal
 attach separately to the side of the ovary, or is there a raised rim of
 receptacle forming a cup above the ovary? This rim of receptacle is
 often referred to as the “**hypanthium**”.

5. Take another flower or a young developing fruit and cut transversely
 through the ovary (below the perianth). Examine the cut face with a hand
 lens. Note the radiating walls between the ovule containing chambers
 (**locules**). The ovules are attached to the central **placenta**. You
 may have to dig some out with a needle to show that they are attached.
 What term describes this arrangement?

6.  Examine the mature fruits (if available). Are they:

7. dry and woody, or papery? Do they split open to release the seeds?
 Such fruits are termed **capsules**. Most Australian members of the
 family have this type of fruit. Each locule opens by a separate slit or
 valve in the top of the fruit. The seeds are mostly very small and wind
dispersed **or**  fleshy and coloured (eg., pink or white). Remove the flesh. Is there
 a single central stony ‘kernel’, or are there several separate seeds?
 These are indehiscent fruits, termed a ‘drupe’ (single kernel) or
‘berry’ (several seeded). They are mostly animal dispersed, though
 sometimes water-borne, and characterise most of the extra-Australian
 members of the family (mostly in the tropics). Some Australian
 rainforest species have this type of fruit. Opposite leaves are common
 in these species, also.

## Family Rutaceae - the Citrus family.

The family includes 150 genera and 1,600 species, of which 40 genera and
335 species occur in Australia.

Habit: *woody* trees and shrubs.

Leaves: exstipulate, *often compound*, and contain *translucent oil
glands* imparting an aroma when crushed.

Flowers: usually actinomorphic, and either *pentamerous* or
*tetramerous*, with a *superior ovary* and *stamens up to twice as
numerous* as the other parts -

\* Kn Cn A2n-n G*(n)* where n = 4 or 5

There is a *nectariferous disc* surrounding the base of the ovary.

Fruits: berries or capsules.

Notes: similar to the Myrtaceae in having gland-dotted leaves, but can
be distinguished by the superior ovary, and in many cases by the
presence of compound leaves.

Important genera in Australia:

- *Boronia* Sm. (94 species - flowers tetramerous - many very attractive; all NSW species are protected); 

- *Eriostemon* Sm. (33 species - Wax Flowers - flowers pentamerous); 

- *Zieria* Sm. (25 species - flowers tetramerous with only one whorl of stamens).

###ID Exercises


 Examine the leaves on the range of specimens provided. Do any have
 compound leaves? Do they have serrate margins. Hold a leaf of each up
 and look through it with a hand lens against the light (window). Are
 translucent oil glands visible? Look from both surfaces. The family
 may have simple or compound leaves (cf. Myrtaceae), and are
 characterised by **oil glands** in the mesophyll (and flowers). Can
 you detect a distinctive aroma from a crushed leaf? Recall the strong
 smell of orange and lemon peel.

Examine a flower, and note the radial symmetry.

- How many stamens are present? Check more than one flower. Is there a
constant number or does it vary? Does the number relate simply to the number of
petals? Is it equal to or twice the number of petals?

- Is the ovary superior or inferior? Examine how the style attaches to
the ovary. Does it arise out of the summit, or from a central depression, or from between
lobes on the top of the ovary? The last two attachments are often
referred to as ‘**gynobasic**’ (the style arising from the base of the
ovary).

- Look for a swollen ring of glandular tissue between the stamens and
the base of the ovary, or lobes of such tissue. This is the **nectary**, which serves to
attract the pollinating animals. A ‘**nectariferous disc**’ is a feature
of most members of the family.

- Cut a TS of the ovary, or preferably a young fruit. Note the number
of locules and the axile placentation. The fruits may be capsules (dry fruits that
split to release the seeds), or fleshy berries (small oranges?). To
which part of the fruit does the fleshy segment of an orange correspond?

- Check the distinguishing features of the family illustrated above
with the notes on the Rutaceae under Family Descriptions. The key characters for
identifying the family are underlined. Which features distinguish the
Rutaceae from the Myrtaceae?

## Subfamily Faboideae: a subfamily within Fabaceae

### (alternate name Papilionoideae) 

500 genera, 12,000 species, worldwide in distribution.  59 m.y.o. (Lavin et al. 2005)

The alternative name Leguminosae is sometimes also applied to the Fabaceae. This traditional name is unusal because it is based on a morphological feature, the legume or pod, instead of a type genus.  The name Fabaceae conforms to modern practices becasue it is based on a genus, *Faba*.

Habit: very variable, from trees to herbs and climbers.

Leaves: usually alternate, *often stipulate and/or compound*.

Flowers: *highly zygomorphic and pea-like*, though sometimes showing
reduction in the size or number of the parts; sepals 5, connate at the
base; petals 5, the adaxial one much enlarged and prominent (the
"standard"), the two abaxial ones connate to form a "keel" enclosing the
stamens and style and itself enclosed by the two lateral petals (the
"wings"); stamens 10 or sometimes 9, often connate; carpel 1; ovary
superior with marginal placentation.

Fruit: a *legume or pod splitting down both sides*; seeds
non-endospermic, often large; embryo bilaterally symmetrical.

Notes: Many of the species are of economic importance as food or crop
plants (*Vicia faba* L., Broad Bean; *Pisum sativum* L. Green Pea;
*Medicago* L. spp., Clovers and Lucerne), timber (*Castanospermum
australe* A. Cunn., Black Bean), and as a source of dyes (*Indigofera
anil* L. and *I. tinctoria* L., Indigo) , medicines and oils. Most
species have the capacity to form symbiotic relationships with
nitrogen-fixing bacteria (root nodules).

Their seed protein contains the amino acid lysine, essential for human
nutrition but absent from all other plant proteins; they are therefore
important components of vegetarian diets.

### ID Excercises

Examine the floral morphology of the specimen(s) provided.

- Note that the flower is strongly zygomorphic (bilaterally
symmetrical).

- Is there a distinct calyx and corolla?

- How many parts are in each of these whorls? Are any or all the parts
 in either whorl fused (connate)? When parts are connate, look for the
 mid-veins as a clue to how many parts are present. Note that the
 members of one whorl may be very different from each other.

- Are the stamens free (separate from each other) or connate or a
combination of the two?

- Note the single long curved style. Look for developing fruits in
 which to work out the structure of the ovary, since the unfertilised
 ovary is too small.

- Is the ovary superior or inferior (look for position of sepal remains
 on the fruit)? How are the ovules arranged within the locule?

- Does the mature fruit split along one seam only so that the ovary
 opens like a book, or along two seams so that the ovary separates into
 halves? This type of fruit is a pod or *legume*.

- Construct a floral formula for the specimen, and then draw a floral
 diagram.

- Is the inflorescence anthotelic or blastotelic?


## Subfamily Mimosoideae, a sub-family within Fabaceae

### The wattle subfamily

82 genera, 3335 species.

Habit: woody shrubs or trees.

Leaves: alternate, *bipinnate*, but often reduced to a *simple phyllode*
in the adult, and often bearing *one or more nectaries on the petiole
and rachis* (midrib of a compound leaf).

Inflorescence: crowded spikes or heads, often arranged in compound inflorescences.

Flowers: small, actinomorphic; calyx and corolla 4 or 5, inconspicuous;
stamens long, numerous and showy; carpel 1; ovary superior with marginal
placentation.

Fruit: a *legume splitting down both sides*; seeds non-endospermic,
often bearing a brightly coloured aril (fleshy collar); embryo with 2
planes of symmetry.

Important genus:

- *Acacia* Willd., about 800 species endemic to Australia, also well
represented in Africa, some in America.  Contraversial genus.  

### ID Excercises

Examine the phyllodinous wattle. The phyllodes are attached in the plane
of the stem rather than transversely, so they do not have an adaxial
(upper) surface, but an adaxial edge. Look for the gland on the upper
edge that is a characteristic feature of *Acacia* petioles. This genus
belongs to the family **Fabaceae** (see note (e) below).

Examine the flowers.

- Can you distinguish a calyx and corolla?

- Is the flower zygomorphic or actinomorphic?

- Note the large and indeterminate number of stamens, and look for the single style. The fruit is a legume or pod, as in the Fabaceae.

- What terms would you use to describe the inflorescence ?

## Family Asteraceae, the Daisy family
### (Alternative name Compositae)

1535 genera, 23,000 species; the largest family of dicotyledons; the
family and many of the genera and even some species distributed
worldwide, mainly in open communities.  A relatively young family, Asteraceae probably has the highest rate of net diversification among all angiosperm families.  

Habit: mostly herbs, often annuals (many desert ephemerals), a few
shrubs and trees.  Often in arid or semi-arid environments.

Inflorescence: a *capitulum* - a cluster of small sessile flowers seated on an expanded
convex stem apex and surrounded by bracts (the *involucre*).

Flowers: calyx either reduced to a ring of scales or hairs, or absent;
corolla connate, 5 (sometimes 4); stamens epipetalous, 5 (4), anthers
connate in a tube surrounding the style; style splitting into 2
stigmatic lobes after emerging from the flower; the *ovary inferior,
unilocular with a single ovule* attached basally.

Within the capitulum the flowers (florets) are often differentiated in
the following ways:

- corolla asymmetrical, giving strap-shaped ray (or ligulate) florets;

- suppression of either or both sexes, giving separate male, female or
sterile florets;

- reduction or differentiation of the pappus (calyx).

The most common condition is a ring of female or sterile *ray florets*
(with a strap-shaped corolla) radiating outwards from the edge of the
capitulum, and a central mass of bisexual tubular *disc florets*.
However, the capitula of some species consist entirely of disc florets,
while others are composed entirely of ray florets.

Fruit: a one-seeded, indehiscent achene (technically termed a
*cypsela*), though rarely a drupe developing a fleshy outer layer as in
*Chrysanthemoides* (Boneseed or Bitou Bush) a weed of coastal dunes. The
ovary wall (pericarp) and seed coat (testa) fuse into a single layer
during maturation of the fruit, and the pappus often develops into an
aid to dispersal.

Notes: The family furnishes a few food plants (*Helianthus annuus* L.,
Sunflower; *H. tuberosus* L., Jerusalem artichoke; *Cynara scolymus* L.,
Globe artichoke; *Lactuca sativa* L., Lettuce; *Cichorium intybus* L.,
Chicory), many horticultural plants (*Chrysanthemum* L., *Dahlia* Cav.,
*Gerbera* Boehm., *Aster* L.) and weeds (*Soliva anthemoides* (Juss.)
R.Br., Bindii; *Taraxacum officinale* Weber ex Wiggers, Dandelion;
*Sonchus* L., Thistles).

### ID Excercises

Examine the specimen(s) provided. There are clusters of tiny flowers
(florets) surrounded by a series of bracts; which may be mistaken for a
single flower. Such a cluster is called a *capitulum* .

1. Dissect apart some flowers from the centre of a capitulum. Is each
 flower subtended by a membranous scale or leaf, or does it arise on the
 receptacle without an associated leaf?

2. Look for the calyx and corolla; the former may be present as branched
or unbranched hairs, or may be totally absent. The petals are fused to form a tube.
How many lobes are there around the mouth of the tube? This indicates
the number of petals in the flower.

3. The stamens are borne on the inside of the corolla tube (*epipetalous)*, and the anthers are themselves fused into a tube around the style.

4. How many stamens are there?

5. Does this equal the number of petals?

6. Look for a flower in which the stigma is projecting, and note how
many stigmatic branches there are - this may not reflect the number of
locules present in the ovary, of course.

7. Is the ovary inferior or superior?

8. The fruits are small and indehiscent, and mostly dispersed by wind or
animal vectors.

9. Examine the fruits, noting any mechanism or structure that might aid
dispersal.

10. Construct a floral diagram and a floral formula for the flower.

11. Now examine the flowers (florets) at the outer edge of the capitulum.

12. What (if any) differences exist between the central and marginal
flowers? Construct a floral formula for the marginal floret.

## Family Proteaceae, the Waratah family

1600 species in 80 genera; mostly, but not entirely, a southern hemisphere family with
greatest diversity in the Cape Province of South Africa, south-western
Australia and eastern Australia.

![Range map for Proteaceae from Angiosperm Phylogeny Web (APWeb; www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb)](proteaceaemap.gif)

Habit: *Woody plants*, from great trees to dwarf prostrate undershrubs
and trailing undershrubs.

Leaves: usually *hard or leathery with much sclerenchyma*, exstipulate,
opposite or alternate, ranging from entire isobilateral leaves with
sub-longitudinal venation to highly divided or strongly dorsiventral.

Flowers: *perianth monocyclic and tetramerous*, actinomorphic or
zygomorphic, the segments showing varying degrees of fusion; *ovary
monocarpellary with marginal placentation*; ovules numerous to 2; around
the base of the ovary there may be up to 4 nectiferous glands, single or
variously fused, alternating with the tepals.

[P(4) A4 ] G*1*

Fruit: a drupe, nut, achene or follicle.

Notes: Some of the large rain forest species are economically important
in the timber industry; the wood has wide and deep rays and therefore
yields "oak" figures on cutting - the silky oaks of commerce are
*Cardwellia sublimis* F. Muell. and *Grevillea robusta* Cunn. Many
species have massed flowers in showy inflorescences: e.g., the South
African *Protea* and the Australian *Banksia*, *Telopea* and
*Grevillea*.

The important genera around Sydney are:

- *Banksia* L.f., ca 50 species in Australia. Flowers compacted around
 the thick rachis of a spike, the inflorescence superficially
resembling Bottlebrushes and Paperbarks (Myrtaceae). Perianth tube
very narrow with slender stiff segments that have expanded concave
tips containing the almost sessile anthers.

- *Grevillea* R.Br., ca 200 species throughout Malaysia, New Hebrides, New Caledonia and Australia.

- *Hakea* Schrad., ca 100 species in Australia. The fruits are woody follicles. Leaves isobilateral with sub-longitudinal venation, or terete, pungent-pointed needles.

- *Isopogon* R.Br. ex Knight (ca 35 species) and *Petrophila* R.Br. ex Knight (ca 40 species) are two closely related genera in which the flowers are in contracted cone-like spikes or heads. Drum sticks.

- *Persoonia* Sm., ca 70 species endemic to Australia; many species have isobilateral leaves with sub-longitudinal venation. The flower is actinomorphic and is borne singly in the axils of leaves or bracts. The fruit is a drupe. Geebungs.

Othere interesting species are:

- *Lambertia formosa* Sm., the Honey Flower or Mountain Devil.

- *Macadamia ternifolia* F. Muell., the Queensland Nut or Macadamia nut, is probably the only Australian plant species that has been taken into crop production.

- *Stenocarpus sinuatus* Endl., the Fire-Wheel Tree from northern N.S.W., is commonly planted around Sydney. A drawing of this species is on the cover of this manual.

- *Telopea speciosissima* R.Br., the Waratah, the state emblem of N.S.W.

- *Xylomelum pyriforme* Sm., the Woody Pear.

### ID Excercises

Examine the specimen(s) provided. Note the hard texture of the leaves.
Are they simple or compound, lobed or entire?

a\) Is the flower radially symmetrical or zygomorphic?

b\) Are petals and sepals both present? How many parts are present in
each whorl?

c\) How are the stamens positioned in relation to the perianth?

 Is there anything unexpected about this position?

 Does this explain how the flower has evolved from the more general
 condition in angiosperms (two whorls of perianth and the stamens
 alternating with the petals)?

d\) There is only one carpel in each flower. Examine developing fruits
 and determine whether the ovary is inferior or superior?

## Family Ericaceae, the heaths 

**Formerly the southern hemisphere heaths were included in the family "Epacridaceae"; molecular evidence disproved the existence of Epacridaceae as a real evolutionary group and the southern heaths are now considered to be part of a globally distributed family, Ericaceae**

A large globally distributed family with 126 genera and 4000 species. Boreal to warm temperate, also montane tropics, very rare in lowland tropics.  The species are mainly in wet and dry heathlands and are common on the sandstone around Sydney and in the Blue Mountains. They are known
as Native Heaths.

Habit: Typically *woody* small under-shrubs, shrubs, or sometimes trees.

Leaves: in Australia *usually small and crowded*, alternate, simple, entire,
exstipulate with *palmate or longitudinal venation*.

Flowers: *radially symmetrical and pentamerous*, with few to many
*imbricate bracts below the flower and often grading into the sepals*;
*petals fused into a tube*; *stamens epipetalous*; ovary superior with
1-10 locules.

\* K5 {C(5) A5} G*(1-10)*

Fruit: a capsule or drupe.

### ID Excercises

Examine the specimen(s) provided.

- Examine the small leaves and note the venation pattern.

- Is there a midrib present?

- How does the leaf attach to the stem?

- Are these typical dicotyledonous leaves?

- Examine the base of the flower and determine how many sepals are present.

- Is there anything unusual about the calyx?

- Note the tubular corolla. How many lobes are present?

- The stamens are borne on filaments that arise from the inside of the
 corolla tube. If you pull the petals off, the stamens come away with
 them. Such stamens are said to be *epipetalous*.

- Is the ovary superior or inferior?

- Examine a fruit and determine how many locules are present.

- Construct a floral formula.

## Identifying unknowns

The following summarises the way you should proceed to identify any
unknown specimen. First determine if the plant is a monocotyledon or a dicotyledon. If the
specimen is a monocotyledon, have a closer look – if it has
modified/reduced flowers and/or spikelets, go to the family key to
determine if it belongs to **CYPERACEAE** or not. If the specimen has
well developed flowers, use the full family key for
monocotyledons to determine in which family the specimen belongs.

If the specimen is a dicotyledon, first check whether it belongs to one
of the major families or subfamilies you should recognise. Only if it does not belong
to one of these families should you use the key to families. Otherwise,
go direct to the key to genera in the family you have recognised.

-  Hold a leaf up to the light and examine with a X10 lens for the
    presence of translucent oil glands.

    - If oil glands are present the specimen belongs to...**MYRTACEAE** or **RUTACEAE**

    - If the ovary is superior, it belongs to.................................**RUTACEAE**

    - If the ovary is inferior, it belongs to................................**MYRTACEAE**

>*If the leaves are compound, it must be a member of Rutaceae. Simple leaves occur in both families.*

If there are no oil glands in the leaves, then continue through this key.

- Examine the inflorescence. Is it a capitulum? That is, does it
 consist of many small tubular flowers without sepals, but the whole
 cluster surrounded by numerous bracts resembling sepals.

    - If so, it belongs to................................................**ASTERACEAE**.

> *Check that the ovary is inferior, the corolla is tubular, and the
anthers are connate and epipetalous to confirm the identification.*

If the inflorescence is not a capitulum, then -

- Are the flowers in dense heads without an involucre of surrounding bracts? Are the stamens the main display of the flowers? Does the plant have bipinnate leaves or phyllodes? Look for the marginal gland. Is the
 fruit a legume or pod?

    - If "yes" is the answer to all these questions, the specimen belongs in........**MIMOSOIDEAE.**

If these features are not present, then -

- Examine a flower externally. Are both sepals and petals present or is there only one perianth whorl?

    - If there is a single perianth whorl of 4 parts, it is........**PROTEACEAE**.

> *Check that there are 4 stamens opposite the perianth parts to confirm
> the identification.*

If this does not apply, then -

- Is the flower radially symmetric and does it have a tubular corolla?

- If so, are there small bracts resembling sepals below the calyx?

    - If so, it belongs to.......................................**ERICACEAE**.

> *Check leaf venation and for epipetalous stamens to confirm the
> identification.*

- If the flowers are zygomorphic, do they have a 'standard', a 'keel' and 2 'wings'? Is the fruit is a legume or pod developed from a superior ovary?

     - If so, the specimen belongs in the ..................................**FABOIDEAE**.

> *Compound leaves and stipules are common in this subfamily.*

If none of these features apply, then go to the family key.

Get used to using these key characters to recognise the large Australian
dicotyledon families. This skill will be tested in the practical exam. It will frequently enable you to
avoid having to wade through the family key because you can go directly to the generic key in that
family.
